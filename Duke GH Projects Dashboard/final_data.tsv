6	Telehealth to Reduce Suicidality and lmprove HIV Care Engagement in Tanzania		Tanzania	https://reporter.nih.gov/search/kOLzXbe2vUu5hfUj4f4huQ/project-details/10257782	April 2021	Ongoing	This K08 Career Development Award will provide Dr. Knettel with the training and mentorship to become an independent clinical scientist focused on developing novel, yet scalable mental health interventions in resource-limited settings. The objective of the research is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 3-session, nurse-delivered telehealth intervention to reduce suicidality and improve HIV care engagement among adults living with HIV in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. Suicide is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide and mental health disorders are key contributors to poor HIV care engagement, lower quality of life, higher transmission risk, and increased mortality among PLWH. Conversely, connecting PLWH with targeted mental health support improves these critical health outcomes. Telehealth counseling represents a cost-effective, innovative approach to mental health treatment in low-resource settings such as Tanzania, with the potential to `leapfrog' less efficient approaches and expediently extend services. The study will include Aim 1: Identifying the desired characteristics of a telehealth intervention for suicidality and HIV care engagement in the Tanzanian clinical context, Aim 2: Refining intervention content with support from a local study advisory board in Tanzania, and Aim 3: Testing the telehealth model in a pilot randomized control trial. Given emerging evidence for telehealth approaches to improve access to treatment and reduce health disparities, the intervention has great potential to support NIMH strategic objectives to address mental health comorbidities and strengthen the HIV care continuum.

7	Sauti ya Vijana (SYV): A Mental Health Intervention to Improve HIV Outcomes Among Tanzanian Youth	Dow, Dorothy	Tanzania	http://sites.duke.edu/sautiyavijana	April 2021	Ongoing	Young people living with HIV (YPLWH, 10-24 years of age) are a growing population that experience unique mental health challenges that may compromise their HIV care. Despite the clear need, few evidence-based mental health interventions exist to address the difficulties faced by this important population. The long-term goal of our research is to provide developmentally appropriate, evidence-based mental health interventions that effectively prevent and treat HIV in young people, especially in low resource settings where the majority of the epidemic occurs. Sauti ya Vijana (SYV, The Voice of Youth), is a novel and innovative group-based mental health and life skills intervention designed with and for Tanzanian YPLWH to address the mental health and life challenges they have described in out prior research. The intervention consists of 10 group sessions (two joint with caregivers) and two individual sessions delivered by trained young adults living with HIV who have successfully transitioned to the adult clinic using a task sharing model that builds local capacity while overcoming the critical shortage of mental health professionals in this setting. SYV incorporates components of Trauma Informed-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and Motivational Interviewing that during this critical neurodevelopmental period when foundations of self and social regulation are realized, may help to prevent or dramatically reduce severity of mental health symptoms.

12	Sepsis Characterization in Kilimanjaro (SICK)	Rubach, Matthew	Tanzania	https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10098876	September 2020	Ongoing	Sepsis is a leading cause of in-hospital death in high-income countries, and it likewise causes a formidable burden of disease in low-income countries, where in-hospital mortality for severe sepsis can exceed 60%. Building upon Duke University’s strong collaborative clinical research platform in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, these studies will use data-driven clustering methods and Bayesian latent class models to define clinically meaningful subtypes of sepsis that are specific to the infectious disease epidemiology and population sub-structures of sub- Saharan Africa (sSA). In doing so, we seek to advance the long-term goal of improving detection, risk stratification and, eventually, tailored interventions for sepsis among adults in resource-limited settings. The rationale driving this project is that sepsis subtype characterization holds great promise for improving the evaluation, management and clinical investigation of sepsis in sSA. To perform our characterizations of adult sepsis subtypes, we will leverage existing samples and data from our research platform’s 2016-2019 severe febrile illness cohort to inform a two-year prospective observational study of sepsis admissions at district hospitals in Kilimanjaro. By developing a precision medicine-based approach to classify the key pathophysiologic subtypes of sepsis in sSA, this project promotes the US National Institutes of Health’s mission to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone—in this case, better health for the most severely ill in the region with the highest burden of sepsis in the world.To achieve this, the project has set out SPECIFIC AIMS that will develop clinical phenotype clusters of adult sepsis derived from clinical bioinformatics using Bayesian statistics (Aim 1) as well as immunologic sepsis clusters based upon the molecular characterization of the host immune response to infection (Aim 2). We will integrate the approaches in Aim 1 and Aim 2 in order to identify robust and clinically meaningful subtypes of sepsis in Kilimanjaro (Aim 3). In Year 1, we will use the existing samples and data collected 2016-2019 to develop and refine the statistical and analytical models for our Aims. This will inform the analytical framework for the prospective sepsis patient cohort in Years 2-3, which will be the basis for both derivation and validation of the clinical and molecular sepsis subtype classifications. The clinical clusters and molecular characterizations discovered in Aim 1 and Aim 2 will also be compared to findings from clinical bioinformatic and gene expression signature analyses that have described sepsis subtypes in Europe and North America. The disease epidemiology of sepsis in sSA—high prevalence of advanced HIV infection and more diverse sepsis etiologies—as well as potential host genetic differences compared to European and North American sepsis patients necessitate that subtype identification be specifically derived and validated for application in sSA. Not only will this project identify subtypes that improve triage and tailored intervention design for sepsis in sSA—it will also establish a framework for sepsis research in a setting where the greatest gains are needed and where the greatest improvements in sepsis outcomes can indeed be made.

19	The Impact of Land Use Change on Transmission Potential Networks and Disease Spread in Rural Madagascar	Nunn, Charles,Kramer, Randall	Madagascar		July 2019	Ongoing	Anthropogenic land use alters ecological communities and impacts transmission of infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases to humans. This project aims to model the transmission pathways for infectious disease in relation to land use and health disparities.  We are collecting ecological and socioeconomic data from different environments in rural Madagascar and assessing transmission correlates using multilayer networks. We are especially interested in identifying the socioeconomic factors that lead some people to be more connected to wildlife and to one another, an area that we term One Health Disparities. We will test whether these networks predict infection with multiple pathogens, including Leptospira, Yersinia, Hantaviruses, Rickettsia, and gastrointestinal helminths.

21	Exploring risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in South Africa		South Africa		February 2018	February 2018	PI: Melissa WattCo-PI: Soraya Seedat (Stellenbosch University)Investigator: Kathleen SikkemaFunder: DGHI Pilot Grant, 2015-2016Site: Cape Town, South AfricaAlcohol use during pregnancy is recognized for its deleterious impacts on fetal development and neonatal outcomes, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Western Cape Province of South Africa, historically a wine-growing region, has among the highest rates of FASD globally. Reducing the incidence of FASD in the Western Cape requires novel prevention interventions that target individuals at high risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Our research in Cape Town suggests that targeting women who drink in alcohol-serving venues can be a feasible and effective strategy for FASD prevention. One strategy for primary prevention of FASD is the prevention of unintended pregnancies among women who drink at hazardous levels. Among a cohort of 560 women whom we recruited from alcohol-serving venues and followed over 12 months, 20% became pregnant; almost all pregnancies were unintended, and in almost all cases women continued to drink heavily during pregnancy. Developing interventions to reduce unintended pregnancy among women who drink requires a nuanced understanding of their attitudes, social norms, and beliefs that influence contraceptive use, as well as an understanding of the structural and contextual barriers and facilitators that impact their ability to access and use contraceptives effectively. The objective of this DGHI small grant is to understand pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use patterns among women who drink in alcohol-serving venues.This mixed-methods study builds on our history of community-engaged research in South Africa to address the following aims:Aim #1: To quantitatively document factors influencing pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use among women who attend alcohol-serving venues, by conducting cross-sectional surveys of 120 women recruited from four alcohol-serving venues.Aim #2: To qualitatively explore the social norms, barriers, and facilitators that influence consistent and effective use of contraceptives among women who engage in hazardous drinking, by conducting in-depth interviews with 24 women purposively recruited from the survey respondents.Aim #3: To assess available contraceptive options and to identify structural factors that support or obstruct access to contraception, by conducting a structured situational analysis of reproductive health services available in the community.This study is complete. Among 200 women surveyed, almost all met criteria for hazardous drinking. In total, 20.3% of sexually active women were identified as at-risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, and two women were currently pregnant and drinking. A majority of sexually active participants reported consistent use of a modern contraceptive; most contraceptives were short-acting methods such as injectables. Of the 176 participants who reported previous pregnancies, 64.8% said they drank alcohol during a previous pregnancy and 51.1% met criteria for hazardous drinking during that pregnancy. Given the high rates of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, alcohol-serving venues should be targeted for FASD prevention interventions. Efforts should be made to increase uptake of long-acting contraceptives among women who do not wish to get pregnant, and to promote alcohol cessation among women with pregnancy intentions.

22	Development of Mental Health Treatment for Obstetric Fistula Patients in Tanzania		Tanzania		February 2018	February 2018	PI: Melissa WattCo-investigator: Kathleen J. SikkemaFunder: NICHD, R21, 2013-2015 (Supplementary funding by the Fistula Foundation)Partner: KCMC in Moshi, TanzaniaObstetric fistula is a hole between the bladder and the vagina, which develops when obstructed labor is not relieved by cesarean section and results in uncontrollable leaking of urine and/or feces. The only cure for obstetric fistula is surgical repair, but many women suffer for years without treatment. Multiple studies have documented the social and psychological impact of obstetric fistula, which includes social isolation, stigma, depression, and mental health dysfunction. However, to date no intervention studies have evaluated empirically-supported therapies to assist in psychological healing among fistula patients. The proposed study aims to fill this gap by developing and pilot-testing a theoretically informed mental health intervention for women receiving surgical repair for obstetric fistula at KCMC Hospital in Moshi, Tanzania.The study has three specific aims: 1) To develop the nurse-delivered mental health intervention, built on theories of coping and cognitive behavioral therapy, 2) To assess feasibility and acceptability of implementing the intervention in the KCMC fistula ward, considering: intervention fidelity, patient satisfaction, provider feedback and cost of delivery, 3) To assess effectiveness of the intervention by comparing immediate and short term outcomes in 30 women who receive the experimental intervention with 30 women receiving the standard of care counseling, examining differences in primary outcomes (depression, PTSD and somatic symptoms) and secondary outcomes (coping, perceived stigma, social support, social participation, efficacy to engage with providers, adherence to clinical recommendations and social reintegration).This study is complete. The intervention development process was published in a paper in the journal Evaluation and Program Planning. There, we describe the 6-session individual-level intervention, based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and coping theory, that was developed for delivery by a community-health nurse. Intervention outcomes are reported in Pilot and Feasibility Studies. A nurse-delivered mental health intervention was feasible to implement as part of in-patient clinical care and regarded positively. There were sharp and meaningful improvements in mental health outcomes among participants over time, with no evidence of differences by condition.

23	Identifying opportunities to promote engagement in HIV care following childbirth in South Africa		South Africa		February 2018	Ongoing	PI: Melissa WattCo-PI: John Joska (University of Cape Town)Investigator: Kathleen SikkemaFunder: Duke Center for AIDS Research, 2015-2016Site: Cape Town, South AfricaNearly one in three pregnant women in South Africa is living with HIV. Under the new Option B+ protocol for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), all pregnant women initiate lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Engagement of women in HIV care following childbirth has proven to be problematic, and may compromise the success of the Option B+ protocol. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct qualitative research to understand the complex array of factors that support or obstruct women's engagement with HIV care in the postpartum period, in order to identify specific intervention targets. The hypothesis is that mental health and social relationships play important roles in shaping long-term care engagement. The study team will first review existing clinic protocols and policies affecting referrals and integration of care across relevant services (antenatal care, birthing and delivery, infant care, and HIV clinics) and conduct 5-10 key informant interviews with providers and administrators at these sites. Second, the study team will conduct repeated in-depth interviews with 20 women who initiated ART during pregnancy. Interviews will be conducted during the last trimester of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum in order to understand the factors that influence how women negotiate engagement in HIV care in the postpartum period. In order to provide broader perspectives on care engagement, women will also be asked to refer a support person for an interview. The qualitative data will be analyzed in an iterative fashion, using a content analytic approach that involves analytic memos, data display matrices, thematic coding, and triangulation across data sources. At the completion of this study, the study will have produced data to inform the development and pilot test of an intervention to support women's continuous engagement in HIV care following childbirth.Data collection concluded in 2017, with analysis of interviews underway.

SikkemaFunder: Fogarty International Center, D43, 2013-2019Partner: KCMC in Moshi, TanzaniaResponding to Tanzanian National priorities for the prevention of HIV and the care of persons living with HIV, Duke University and the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) developed a Sociobehavioral Sciences (SBS) Core at KCMC focused on HIV/AIDS. SBS research skills are essential for understanding critical issues relating to HIV testing, linkage and retention in care, treatment adherence, and co-morbidities such as mental illness and substance abuse, which relate strongly to clinical outcomes. Their research will expand existing collaborative research efforts under the leadership of the newly developed KCMC SBS Core Team.Given the goal of research independence and creation of a regional training facility for the Team by April 2018, we have developed a plan for team composition which emphasizes robust and complementary SBS research skills. Candidates are receiving PhD training pursuing expertise in epidemiology/public health, health promotion/behavior, psychology, biomedical engineering/rapid diagnostics, and biostatistics; one in medical training for psychiatry. Additional team members will initiate medium- and short-term training to develop expertise in psychiatry, public health aspects of mental illness, nursing, data management and research administration.  All training is conducted in unique model in collaboration with the University of Cape Town (UCT).Strong mentorship is offered by faculty at Duke University, KCMC, and UCT, through their expertise and funded research in SBS aspects of HIV infection. Program administration builds upon the past training successes of the KCMC-Duke collaboration, and future success will be ensured through careful communication, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and accountability to the Training Advisory Committee and an External Advisory Committee.

29	Elderly Health Literacy: A Multi-Country Comparator Study	Moe, Jeffrey	United States		November 2017	Ongoing	The aging of the Chinese population places a significant burden upon its health system. The China health system strategy for elder care relies on the concept of 'subsidiarity': care is provided at the closest immediate level (the patient, patient's family) before seeking additional care at higher levels (community or tertiary care providers and facilities). To implement subsidiarity assumes the elderly have an adequate level of health literacy to provide for their own care or care provided to them by loved ones. Health literacy includes disease prevention, early intervention; treatment approaches, especially for non-communicable diseases (NCD), and rehabilitation nursing. Health education also includes an understanding of medical service systems, schools, community, enterprise or social organizations; and includes the use of mass media and government public health initiatives. The study examines approaches to elderly health literacy found in Japan, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. From those comparator countries best practices and research tested approaches to increase elderly health literacy are identified for consideration by the study sponsors.	Health policy and systems			
30	Immigration Laws and Health	LeGrand, Sara			October 2017	Ongoing	This study will examine the influence of actual and perceived immigration laws on US Latino and Hispanic immigrants' willingness to utilize, and actual utilization of, services for HIV testing and two additional stigmatized conditions of public health significance that are explicitly addressed in US immigration laws - alcohol and drug use disorders (AODD) and intimate partner violence (IPV). Specifically, we will examine how US Latino and Hispanic immigrants' concerns about preserving requisite health, character, and financial standing for US residency and/or their desire to avoid government attention or detection of their own or a loved one's undocumented status, can deter those at risk for HIV infection from seeking HIV testing and seeking services for AODD and IPV, when appropriate. Study participants will be adult, Spanish-speaking, non-citizen (documented and undocumented) Latino Hispanic immigrants to the US living in one of four US metropolitan areas, Chicago and Los Angeles (more welcoming/inclusive immigration policy environments) and Phoenix and Charlotte, NC (more restrictive immigration policy environments). The sample composition in each city will reflect the demographic profile of Hispanic immigrants in each metropolitan area in terms of age, gender, national origin and documentation status. In the first phase of this 3-phase project, in-depth individual and focus group interviews with local key informants and immigrant residents will highlight actual and perceived legal barriers and facilitators for HIV testing and utilization of services for alcohol and drug use disorders and intimate partner violence in each metropolitan area. These legal barriers and facilitators will be examined during subsequent legal analysis, both for their congruence with participants' understandings of the laws and policies and for comparison of legal environments across project sites. In Phase 2, of the study, Phase 1 findings will be used to refine and expand a novel measure of immigration law concerns which will then undergo rigorous review by key informants and project advisors. In Phase 3 of the study, the resultant measure will serve as the primary independent variable in a quantitative analysis of the relationship between Latino and Hispanic immigrants' immigration law-related concerns and their willingness to utilize, and actual utilization of, when appropriate, services for HIV testing, AODD and IPV. Samples of 400 Latino and Hispanic immigrants in each metropolitan area will complete the survey via ACASI. Findings from the proposed study will provide important evidence for intervention, whether at the individual-level, through efforts to correct deleterious misconceptions of laws, at the community-level, through the development of more effective public health strategies to reach immigrant groups, and at the structural-level by shaping laws, polices, and procedures that support the goals of our National HIV Prevention Strategy.Immigration-related laws and importantly, immigrants' perceptions of these laws, can encourage, deter, or even prevent immigrants from engaging in important public health behaviors including being tested for HIV infection and seeking services for conditions that may increase one's risk of contracting HIV. The proposed study will examine the influence of actual and perceived immigration-related laws and policies on US Hispanic and Latino immigrants' willingness to be tested for HIV and to utilize services for two additional, legally-regulated and stigmatized public health priorities: alcohol and drug use disorders and intimate partner violence. Findings from the proposed study will provide important evidence for intervention, whether at the individual-level, through efforts to correct deleterious misconceptions of laws, at the community-level, through the development of more effective public health strategies to reach immigrant groups, and at the structural-level by shaping laws, polices, and procedures that support the goals of our National HIV Prevention Strategy.

Staff will also coordinate housing, international and local travel prior to trainee arrival. Upon completion of the program a completion certificate will be awarded after a student successfully completes 9 credit hours with a grade point average of 3.0 or more. Summer Courses On-campus in an Intensive Format: The curriculum will consist of four One Health on-campus courses including 1) Introduction to the One Health Approach, 2) Public Health Laboratory Techniques, 3) An Introduction to Entomology, Zoonotic Diseases, and Food Safety, and 3) An Introduction to Environmental Health. **The Pakistan & Philippines projects:** This project will train Pakistani/Philippine life-scientists to detect novel and emerging BEP priority diseases that arise from the human-animal interface in Pakistan and the Philippines. Trainees will receive lectures in conducting surveillance and planning secure, safe, and effective interventions against biological WMD including pathogens causing: anthrax, plague, tularemia, Ebola, and other agents on NIH category A list. Under this program, professionals from participating university institutes (e.g. public or veterinary health sectors), chosen in close coordination with BEP, will receive one week of intensive training on the One Health approach, epidemiology methods, and culture free diagnostics of several BEP priority viruses. Key training site elements will include lecture and virology laboratory facilities. Possible sites where we have strong collaborations include Duke-NUS Singapore, the national public health laboratories in the Republic of Georgia, or other location to be identified in close coordination with BEP. After participants complete the training course, they will be remotely mentored to develop surveillance programs over a period of 11 months to develop novel virus detection techniques. The training and follow-up program will be designed to help the trainees establish a sustainable surveillance program for novel agent detection while building long-term collaborative relationships between in-country academic animal and human health sectors, as well as with international partners. After the training, Duke will provide trainees with appropriate laboratory startup kits, quality assurance panels, and further remote training in their home country. These kits will be procured in close coordination with BEP. During the 11 months of their surveillance program, the team will collect and analyze samples. The scientists will work together to perform molecular detection algorithms for the identification of newly emerging biological threats. Duke University will follow all necessary U.S. and international regulations to facilitate this scientific collaboration.	Infectious diseases,One Health			
32	Effects of perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal development	Feng, Liping	China,United States		September 2017	Ongoing	Perﬂuoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are chemicals widely used in industrial and household products. Because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxic properties, PFASs have been recognized as emerging environmental pollutants. Therefore, several actions have been taken by industry and regulators to phase-out the production of some commonly detected long-chain PFASs. As a consequence, the production of these chemicals has shifted from developed countries toward developing countries, especially China. The most developed city in China, Shanghai, has the highest concentrations of PFASs in the soil, sediment, and surface water. Besides shifted countries of production, many manufacturers have begun to produce and use short-chained PFASs, such as perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) as a replacement for PFOS. PFBS is also persistent and bioaccumulative. Additionally, the water-solubility of PFBS is higher than PFOS, which makes it more mobile and problematic if contaminated surface water is used as a drinking water source. Consequently, there is a significantly increasing trend of PFBS in the environment and in people worldwide. Currently, there are no restrictions on the production and use of PFBS which is assumed to be less toxic than PFOS, and there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the level of human exposure and public health impact of PFBS. It is imperative that the impact of exposure and subsequent toxicity of PFBS be assessed to better inform health policy and regulation of their use.Humans are exposed to PFASs via various pathways, including drinking water, diet, outdoor air, indoor dust, and soil. Such exposure has been linked to a number of adverse health conditions including cancer and abnormal reproductive development (USEPA, 2014). Available data including our unpublished data suggest that widespread exposure to PFBS may adversely affect human health including reproductive health. Although a direct causal association between maternal exposure of PFBS and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) has not yet been reported, the toxicity of PFBS as shown in previous studies correlates highly with the pathophysiology (abnormal placenta development) of PIH such as endocrine disrupting, differential toxicity in human placental trophoblast cells, immunotoxicity; and transcriptional effects. Our pilot epidemiology study showed a positive association between PFBS exposure and risk of PIH which is the leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In addition, a recent study showed that exposure of pregnant mice to PFBS causes hypothyroxinemia and abnormal development of female offspring. Our pilot study took a step further and demonstrated that cord blood level of PFBS is associated with lower levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in both maternal and cord blood in our pregnant human cohort. Proper thyroid hormone levels are critical for fetal growth and the maintenance of healthy pregnancy. Thus, maternal exposure of PFSB could affect short- and long-term health of both mothers and babies. The proposed study is uniquely positioned to answer critical public health questions about how perinatal exposure of PFBS impacts maternal and fetal health conditions. This study is a critical step towards exposure reduction policies for improving public health. We aims to determine the maternal PFBS exposure and the maternal and fetal outcomes and the underlining mechanisms.

33	Community-sourced Interventions for Global Mental Health	Puffer, Eve	Kenya		September 2017	Ongoing	"The burden of disease attributable to mental, neurological, and substance-abuse disorders is greater than that of any other disease category. Although research in recent decades has elucidated the extensive health and economic impacts of mental disorders globally, only recently have such efforts been met with increased attention and funding to reduce the disease burden. In high-income countries, decades of research have contributed to a strong evidence base regarding effective psychological interventions. However, the burden of mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains largely unaddressed. Barriers to implementation of evidence-based interventions in LMIC settings include shortage of human resources for mental healthcare, cultural differences in understanding of mental health and illness, and stigma regarding mental disorders and seeking mental healthcare. These shortcomings can be addressed through implementation science research, which attends to the ways that existing evidence-based interventions can be implemented across diverse contexts for greatest reach, acceptability, and fidelity. The proposed project integrates training and research designed to develop my expertise in implementation of evidence-based psychological interventions among underserved populations. The proposed project will build on my strong research background in anthropology and epidemiology, by providing training in (1) implementation science principles and practice, (2) implementation-effectiveness hybrid designs for psychological interventions, and (3) strategies to optimize fidelity to intervention mechanisms of change in diverse implementation settings. The training plan includes coursework, directed readings, seminars, mentored research, and participation in national and international conferences and workshops. The proposed research will apply implementation science concepts in an implementation-effectiveness hybrid design of Tuko Pamoja (Swahili: ""We are Together""), an evidence-based family-therapy intervention aiming to improve family dynamics and mental health in the context of Kenya. First, I will perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of existing pilot study data from the Tuko Pamoja intervention. I will systematically identify community-sourced practices that are predictive of positive implementation outcomes (acceptability and fidelity) and effectiveness outcomes (mental health and family functioning) within the pilot study. I will then develop an implementation strategy that formally incorporates these community-sourced practices into the intervention, and I will implement and evaluate the revised intervention. I will use qualitative methods to evaluate implementation outcomes and will use a series of single-case (N=1) studies to evaluate effectiveness outcomes. This research will inform the field of global mental health and contribute to its nascent development of implementation science processes for translating evidence-based psychological interventions to varied contexts. At the completion of this fellowship, I will have specialized expertise in implementation methodologies for psychological interventions and will be prepared to pursue a program of independent research in global mental health."

36	Reducing stigma among healthcare providers to improve mental health services (RESHAPE)	Turner, Elizabeth	United States		July 2017	Ongoing	**Scope of Work/Abstract** Despite growth in evidence-based practices (EBP) for depression, there is limited implementation of these services due to lack of mental health specialists. Tasksharing, in which primary care and community health workers assume some responsibilities of health specialists, has the potential to reduce the gap between depression burden and scarce services. Nevertheless, there are barriers to tasksharing, including stigma against people with mental illness among the very health workers who could assume some responsibilities of health Stigma is associated with low motivation of primary care workers to participate in mental health trainings, which therefore compromises their ability to undertake the responsibilities asked of them. The overall goal of the current project is to tackle stigma against people with mental illness, specifically amongst primary care and community health workers. A major component of the project is the implementation of a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate an innovative anti-stigma training program. If successful, it could ultimately lead to higher quality care for people with mental illness. The work to be completed by the DGHI analytics team is essential for the success of the parent K01 grant. Specifically, Liz Turner will continue her role as faculty biostatistician and Bonnie Kaiser will continue her role as qualitative expert consultant. The team will conduct regular meetings with Dr. Brandon Kohrt and the rest of the Nepali team when needed, will work on data processing, data preparation, the development of analysis plans, the execution of statistical and qualitative analyses, the development and writing of papers and will contribute to capacity building with our Nepali collaborators.

39	Family psychoeducation for adults with psychotic disorders in Tanzania		Tanzania		May 2017	Ongoing	There is an urgent need for global guidance on effective, culturally appropriate, and sustainable psychosocial interventions for mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While the burden of mental illness in LMICs is now well established, there remains a significant treatment gap for mental disorders, particularly for psychotic disorders in sub-Saharan Africa. Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice developed in high-income countries to help individuals with psychotic disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively with the illness; however, FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the mechanisms of action for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified. This project (2017-2020) will pilot test a culturally tailored Family Psychoeducation model (FamPE) for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives. The study design includes formative research to adapt FPE and a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 72 patient/relative dyads to meet these specific aims: 1) Assess how family psychoeducation can improve client outcomes, engage families and address gaps in mental health services in Tanzania; 2) Culturally tailor the FamPE intervention for use in Tanzania; and 3) Pilot test the FamPE intervention and explore its impact on patient relapse, quality of life and disability. **Partners:** Muhimbili University of Health & Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Tanzania and Columbia University in New York NY. **Funder:** National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)	Health policy and systems,Mental health,Monitoring and evaluation		The Trustees of Columbia University	
40	Myanmar Regional International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research		Myanmar		April 2017	Ongoing	New tools for mapping and predicting malaria risk are needed to help National Malaria Control Programs in Southeast Asia to eliminate drug resistant malaria. At sites in central Myanmar and on both sides of its borders with China and Bangladesh, the Myanmar Regional Center of Excellence for Malaria Research integrates findings from clinical and field research, including molecular surveillance, genomic epidemiology and geospatial mapping and modeling of malaria risk, to provide essential knowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies to stratify malaria risk, with the ultimate aim of accelerating malaria elimination in the region.Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria appeared in Southeast Asia ten years ago, posing a serious threat to global malaria control and elimination. Based in part on our findings about the patterns of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in the region, in 2015 the WHO abandoned its strategy of trying to contain artemisinin resistance, and the World Health Assembly approved a new WHO recommendation to launch a campaign to completely eliminate falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia. Along with other countries at the 2015 East Asia Summit, Myanmar, the emerging democracy formerly known as Burma, endorsed a plan for malaria elimination in the region by 2030. To achieve this daunting goal, innovative tools are needed for malaria surveillance, treatment and prevention. Because the heaviest concentrations of malaria in Myanmar and neighboring countries are found in border and conflict areas that are often out of reach of national health systems, malaria elimination—and malaria research in support of elimination—requires a multi-sectoral, cross-border approach. Building on the foundation of a successful malaria research program that we created in Myanmar in 2012 with NIAID grant support, and working closely with local and regional partners, in 2017 we established a new NIH International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) centered in Myanmar, with sites in central Myanmar and on both sides of its borders with China and Bangladesh. Integrating findings from clinical and field research, including molecular surveillance, genomic epidemiology and geospatial mapping and modeling of malaria risk, we are conducting innovative multidisciplinary research that will provide essential knowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies for national malaria control programs and their partners to control, treat and ultimately eliminate malaria in Southeast Asia.The Myanmar Regional ICEMR consists of 3 Projects and 4 Cores. In addition to co-directing the ICEMR with DGHI faculty member Myaing Myaing Nyunt MD PhD MPH, Dr. Plowe directs Project 2, MALARIA PARASITE MIGRATION AND EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF DRUG RESISTANCE.

41	Developing a Smartphone App to Improve Treatment Adherence among South African Adolescents Living with HIV	Mulawa, Marta	South Africa	https://batlab.web.unc.edu/masi	June 2019	Ongoing	Interventions that engage adolescents living with HIV to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are urgently needed. Adolescents repeatedly demonstrate suboptimal levels of ART adherence, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Developing adherence-promoting interventions for adolescents requires an understanding of factors that shape adherence from multiple levels of influence. Developmental theories suggest that adolescents are particularly sensitive to their social networks. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, those that use mobile technology (e.g., smartphones apps) to transmit health information, hold promise as an effective way to improve ART adherence. Notably, these smartphone apps can be used to engage social networks and provide social support. Access to mobile phone technology is rapidly increasing among youth in South Africa, making mHealth interventions feasible and potentially scalable in this setting.The purpose of this study is to customize and pilot MASI (MAsakhane Siphucule Impilo Yethu, Xhosa for “Let’s empower each other and improve our health”), an app-based intervention to promote adherence to HIV treatment among adolescents living with perinatally-acquired HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. MASI is built using the HealthMpowerment platform, a theory-based mHealth platform originally developed by One Cow Standing, a Durham-based software company, for Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Read more about the features of MASI here.This research is conducted in collaboration with Drs. Lisa Hightow-Weidman and Kathryn Muessig at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and with Dr. Jackie Hoare at the University of Cape Town (UCT). We are in the process of iteratively customizing MASI through in-depth interviews and app-testing with adolescents living with HIV in Cape Town. We recently conducted in-depth interviews with 15 adolescents to inform the development and customization of content to address their needs. Next, we will conduct app testing of MASI. Study activities for this phase of research will include a set of two in-depth interviews with 12-16 adolescents living with HIV. During the first interview, we will install MASI on each participant’s phone. Participants will be asked to spend at least 10 minutes a day on the app for 1-3 weeks, until the second interview is scheduled. A second interview will allow participants to provide feedback based on their experience with the app, desired improvements, proposed changes to the community guidelines, and information on facilitators and barriers to uptake and daily engagement as well as any technical difficulties encountered, privacy or confidentiality concerns.

43	Accessible Laparoscopy for Low- and Middle-Income Countries	Fitzgerald, Tamara,Saterbak, Ann,Vissoci, João Ricardo	Uganda		September 2018	Ongoing	Laparoscopic surgery is the standard of care in high-income countries for many operations in the chest and abdomen. Laparoscopic surgery avoids large incisions by using a tiny camera and fine instruments manipulated through keyhole incisions, but it is generally unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to high cost of installment, lack of qualified maintenance personnel, unreliable electricity and shortage of consumable items.  Patients in LMICs would benefit from laparoscopic surgery, as advantages include: decreased pain, improved recovery time, fewer wound infections, and shorter hospital stays. Laparoscopic surgery would reduce recovery time, enabling patients to return to home and work more quickly, thereby mitigating impoverishing health expenditure.KeyScope and KeyLoop (collectively called KeySuite) are laparoscopic prototypes that we have designed for the resources, needs and challenges of LMICs. KeyScope is low-cost laparoscope that plugs into a laptop computer to display images during surgery, exists as a single unit without complicated assembly and is sterilizable by immersion in Cidex. It links to a tele-mentoring application so that experienced surgeons can mentor surgeons in capacity-building partnerships. KeyLoop is a laparoscopic retractor that lifts the abdominal wall during surgery, obviating the need for a constant power supply and medical-grade carbon dioxide. This would enable laparoscopic surgery to be performed in rural hospitals, where most patients live in LMICs, and increase access in tertiary centers where laparoscopic equipment is rare and expensive.This project is currently focused on performing a First-in-Human study in Uganda, gaining regulatory approval through the Uganda National Drug Authority and developing a business model to ensure sustainable manufacturing and scale-up within the region.

The study will proceed in two stages over approximately three and one-half years. In Stage 1, the feasibility and acceptability of the ILOM of TI-CBT program, consisting of 6 two-hour sessions, will be evaluated for 15-19 year-olds living with HIV and their caregivers using the ADAPT-ITT Model. In Stage 2, the efficacy of an ILOM of TI-CBT intervention using a 2-arm randomized controlled trial design will be evaluated for 15-19 year-olds living with HIV and their caregivers. This study will prioritize implementation in countries with high volumes of 15 - 19 year-olds living with HIV, and sites with minimal mental health care infrastructure in order to achieve the biggest impact and deliver the program in areas of greatest need.

45	Maternal exposure to e-waste in Guiyu, China and birth outcomes	Feng, Liping	China		July 2018	Ongoing	In many LMICs, handling e-waste is frequently unregulated. There is increasing concern about health effects related to environmental contamination for people working and living at or near informal e-waste processing sites such as Guiyu, China, especially to the most vulnerable populations, pregnant women and children. Efforts have been underway to move toward a more sustainable process in Guiyu, China. By the end of 2015, all unregulated electronic-waste workshops were moved to a newly built industrial park in Guiyu. Thus, timely evaluation of the human health impact of these movements is needed. We hypothesize that the e-waste exposure level among the pregnant women in this region is going down and birth-outcomes are improved comparing to previous observations. To test our hypothesis, our overall scientific objective is to evaluate maternal e-waste exposure and birth-outcomes.Based on identified knowledge gaps and the significance of filling these gaps, we will:Aim 1: Initiate a Guiyu birth cohort to evaluate the e-waste exposure among pregnant women and birth-outcomes.Aim 2: Initiate a local education program to improve the awareness of the adverse health effects of e-waste exposure and prevention strategies among women. The research environment and resources at both Duke and China are available to support this study. Through this international cooperation, awareness can be elevated about the harm that e-waste processing poses to human health and the effects of interventions. This pilot funding will assist us to build up a long-term collaboration with China and pave a way for external funding on this topic.

51	The development of a platform mimicking the human placental barrier	Feng, Liping	United States		March 2017	Ongoing	Overview: The placenta is a highly specialized organ that plays an integral role in the development and maintenance of pregnancy. Its most important function is exchange of endogenous and exogenous substances, which enables adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, excretion of fetal metabolic waste, and protection against potentially harmful agents, such as pathogens, including the recently identified vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a cause of microcephaly and other birth defects in neonates. Transfer of substances between the intervillous space and fetal capillaries takes place across a multilayered structure often called the “placenta barrier”, which is composed of trophoblasts, connective tissue, basal lamina and fetal endothelium. The other major functions of placenta include the production of hormones and a key immunological mediator during pregnancy. The major hormones it produces are progesterone, estrogen, and chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)21 which serve to maintain a healthy pregnancy, to uphold an optimal environment within the physiology of the mother, and to prepare the mother for birth.Studying the biology of the human placenta represents a major experimental challenge. Previous studies on placenta transport have used a wide range of experimental systems including in vivo animal models, ex vivo placental perfusion systems and in vitro cell cultures. A limitation of animals to model human pregnancy is that placental structure and function vary considerably among species, and current in vitro models have limited ability to dissect the process of placental transfer and to reveal mechanistic insights into its biological underpinnings. It is urgent to develop new models for real-time assessment of placental development and function during normal and abnormal pregnancies. Recently, a novel platform “placenta-on-a-chip” was developed using human cells which recapitulate the critical fetal maternal interface in the villous tree of the human placenta. This model mimics structural characteristics of the human placental barrier and some aspects of physiology. This model has potential to serve as a low-cost experimental platform with a broad range of applications. However, major limitations of this model are (1) use of JEG-3 or BeWo cell line to represent placental trophoblast cells, (2) limited characterization of its endocrine and immunologic function, (3) limited characterization of transport functions and effects of shear stress. JEG-3 and BeWo are human choriocarcinoma cell lines which still keep tumor properties, and, unlike primary cultures, do not spontaneously form syncytia without addition of forskolin27. These cell lines have limited capacity to model changes in placental barrier function during pregnancy. Using these cells raises questions about their ability to represent normal human cytotrophoblasts.Objectives/Aims: Our study objectives are to develop a platform mimicking the human placental barrier based on the existing “placenta-on-a-chip” model using representative human trophoblasts and fetal capillary endothelial cells. Taking a step further, we will test this model for ZIKV transmission after complete characterization and validation of the developed model.

Haiti		March 2017	Ongoing	The aim of this study is to evaluate a screen and treat strategy for preventing cervical cancer that has been proposed as a model for a national cervical cancer prevention program in Haiti.  The proposed screen and treat strategy involves testing vaginal self-collected samples for the presence of oncogenic genotypes of HPV and then treating all HPV positive women with cervical ablation.The motivation for doing the study is to identify potential problems while implementing the program in a research environment before expanding the program to other areas of the country.  The study was approved by the Duke IRB in 2017 to recruit 5,000 research subjects, from Port-au-Prince (urban) and from a rural community surrounding Tom Gato in the mountains between Leogane and Jacmel.  The plan was to do an interim analysis of the study after the first 2,000 subjects so that the screen and treat strategy could be evaluated and improved before recruiting the final 3,000 subjects.  We completed the evaluation of phase 1 of the study, implemented the changes to improve the protocol and anticipate completing study recruitment in 2021.In phase 1 (2,000 subjects), the cervical ablation technique used was cryotherapy.  This was because it was the only cervical ablation method widely available in Haiti at the time.  The plan was to compare traditional cryotherapy using nitrous oxide gas to a gasless CryoPen® device that was under development.  Before phase 1 of the study began, the manufacturer of the gasless CryoPen® decided not to continue supporting this device.  From phase 1 we are now aware that a treatment based on the availability of nitrous oxide gas is not sustainable on a national scale in Haiti.  Therefore in phase 2 (3,000 women), we proposed evaluating a different gasless cervical ablation technique that involves heating the cervical transformation zone rather than freezing it.  This technique was widely used in the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland, in the 1970s and found to be both safe and effective.  The device was originally manufactured in Germany and the device that we using is a modification of that device.  A meta-analysis reports that heating the cervix may be more effective at treating high grade lesions than cryotherapy35.  The technique was originally called cold coagulation, which creates confusion because it is neither cold, or coagulation, but rather involves heating the transformation zone to 100-120 degrees Centigrade for short intervals.  To avoid this confusion, we are referring to this treatment as thermoablation or thermal ablation.In phase 1, one of our goals was to perform cervical ablation on at least 80% of all HPV-positive women and to learn through surveys that the majority patients and providers gave a favorable evaluation of the screening and treatment strategies.  Both of these goals were achieved. However, the cervical ablation target was not met in the rural community until more study personnel were added to the team.  We discovered in the rural community that women were more likely to return if they were contacted through community networking rather than through mobile phone calls.  In phase 2, we now have a dedicated health promoter who is networking in the rural community to encourage women to return for test results and treatment if they are HPV positive.In phase 1, we also learned that vaginal bleeding does not decrease the detection of HPV in vaginal samples so this contraindication has been removed from phase 2.In phase 2, we switched from entering the study data into an Excel spreadsheet to entering the data into a RedCAP registry database, which was created by a member of the study team.  This simulates the data entry process that we anticipate using for the Haitian National Cervix Registry.

53	Spatial Scales of Plasmodium Falciparum Generations: Implications for Elimination	Prudhomme O'Meara, Wendy	Kenya		February 2017	Ongoing	Malaria is a major public health problem, with an estimated 198 million cases occurring world-wide in 2013. Effective strategies to reduce malaria transmission and disease have been highly successful leading to a 40% reduction in malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000. It has been observed that infections cluster geographically and such clustering becomes more pronounced as transmission declines. The science of identifying 'hotspots' of infection or foci of transmission is a growing area that promises to help target interventions more effectively. However, it has not been shown whether infected individuals in close physical proximity (i.e. in the same household) are jointly infected due to simply living in a risky place, or because an infected household member is a risk factor for nearby susceptible individuals. If the former, then targeting hotspots should focus on reducing environmental risk factors in the area around a hotpsot. If the latter, then interventions to identify and treat 'transmitters' will reduce transmission and reduce the incidence of new cases. Therefore, we need to understand the spatial scale of malaria transmission to predict the impact of community case detection and hotspot targeting.To shed light on this important issue, we propose two scientific objectives. First, we will measure the genetic relatedness of infections within the same household compared to the relatedness of infections at further distances. We will determine whether this relationship differs in fever 'hotspots' (geographic clusters of high fever incidence) and fever 'coldspots'. Parasite DNA from dried blood spots collected from a moderate endemic study area in western Kenya (approximately 15 km by 28 km encompassing more than 80 villages) will be sequenced at a moderately polymorphic gene using deep sequencing techniques. This will provide evidence for local, focal transmission if nearby infections are more closely related or will point to mixed transmission whereby infections only begin to differ as you reach the distance of mosquito flying ranges.Our second objective is to trap malaria mosquito vectors and identify infected mosquitoes. We will determine the source of the mosquito's infection by sequencing parasites in the mosquito salivary glands and comparing to parasite genotypes in humans. By doing so, we can find out whether infections are being transmitted at a household scale or transmission is 'well mixed' geographically and only limited by the range of the mosquito. If successful, this will be the first report of linking individual infections in mosquitoes to their human source. The ability to track infections from human to mosquito and back again would allow us to understand the dynamics and scale of transmission in a way that has not previously been possible. We expect to scale up this approach to larger populations in subsequent studies. These results will provide insight into the expected impact of interventions designed to target hotspots.

54	Novel Diagnostics to Improve Antimicrobial Stewardship for Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Resource-Limited Settings	Tillekeratne, L Gayani	Sri Lanka		February 2017	Ongoing	Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse worldwide. Rapid, accurate identification of a pathogen can reduce antibiotic overuse for ARTIs, but is not always possible with available diagnostics. In low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), ARTI diagnosis is further complicated by limited laboratory infrastructure.This project in Sri Lanka will1) define the epidemiology of ARTIs using comprehensive laboratory testing,2) refine a novel host-based gene expression assay that differentiates between viral and bacterial ARTIs. This transcriptomics-based signature was originally developed in a population in the US. Performance will be determined in the Sri Lankan cohort and the signature will be refined.3) determine the performance characteristics of procalcitonin and gene signatures at differentiating between viral and bacterial ARTIs.

Deliverable 1: An optimized bacterial/viral/non-infectious classifier on a nonAt present, our ability to identify the etiology of febrile illness is limited by nonspecific clinical presentations, low sensitivity and prolonged time to positivity of current pathogen specific methods, and in some cases difficulty in determining whether presence of pathogen alone indicates invasive disease. Consequently, there is a compelling need for novel diagnostic approaches to accurately discriminate between viral and bacterial etiology versus non-infectious causes of febrile illness. The host response to pathogens uses pattern recognition receptors tied to specific transcriptional responses that can be measured at the mRNA and protein levels [16, 17]. We hypothesize that we can harness this response to generate robust classifiers and high fidelity assays to distinguish bacterial and viral illnesses that are inclusive of high consequence pathogens of relevance to the modern warfighter. In previous work, we have demonstrated that the host response to common pathogens, in the form of pathogen-class specific, host gene expression classifiers, can address this diagnostic dilemma. The concept of host-based biomarkers of infection is not new. However, only recently has progress in technology for generation of genomic and proteomic data coupled with advances in mathematical and statistical analysis of complex data sets allowed the prospect of rapid and accurate prediction of infection based upon host biomarker profiling. Our team has been at the forefront in the development of host biomarker classifiers of infectious diseases[1-4, 18-20]. We have previously demonstrated that the host response transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome discern pathogen class exposure with high fidelity and specificity. Furthermore, the host response classifiers we have developed can predict those who will go on to symptomatic disease among an exposed population who have not yet developed symptoms.

61	OPAL - Optimizing Provider Attitudes and competence in Learning mental health systems	Kohrt, Brandon	Nepal,Ethiopia		September 2016	Ongoing	Stigma against persons with mental illness by health care providers contributes to lack of delivery of evidence-based care, long duration of untreated mental illness before initiation of care, and lack of appropriate medical care for persons with mental illness. This is compounded by structural stigma within health systems, which is exemplified by policies and practices that fail to meet needs for mental health budgets, psychiatric supervision of primary care providers, and physical infrastructure for safe and effective care. The purpose of our proposed research is to address the vital need for development of intervention packages to address provider stigma and structural stigma, with a focus on psychotic disorders. The rationale for conducting this study in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) is because these regions demonstrate the greatest dearth of evidence-based services, and there is a lack of research on how to reduce stigma in a manner that improves patient clinical outcomes in low resource settings. Our goal is to develop an intervention package for Optimizing Provider Attitudes and competence in Learning mental health systems (OPAL). Drawing on the evidence base for addressing provider stigma, OPAL will include facilitated social contact between providers and persons with mental illness. For structural stigma, learning health systems will serve as a model to improve attitudes and clinical care through patient engagement in service design, enhanced provider access to systems data, and promotion of team-based health system administration. To accomplish the objective of developing the OPAL package to reduce provider and structural stigma, we will undertake three aims: 1. develop a draft intervention package through qualitative research including a stakeholder analysis of the package and a pilot training of trainers for consumers, 2. adapt and develop measures to evaluate the package, and 3. strengthen capacity for implementation science in LMIC. This proposed research will take place in Ethiopia and Nepal. These African and Asian settings exemplify LMIC mental health service needs and are participating in implementation research through Emerging Mental Health Systems in Low and Middle Income Countries (EMERALD) and Programme for Improved Mental Health Care (PRIME), which employ the World Health Organization's (WHO) mental health Global Action Programme (mhGAP).The impact of successful completion of our research aims will be (1) an intervention package that can be added to mhGAP and piloted by WHO, and (2) intervention content and measures to apply for funding to conduct effectiveness trials to evaluate improving provider attitudes and competence as mechanisms to improve patient outcomes.

The FHI Health Humanities Lab takes an inventive, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the health of populations locally and worldwide through work grounded in histories, literatures, languages, cultures, arts, media, and critical theory. The lab structure is intrinsically vertically-integrated, involving undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and community in interest-driven research projects. We are also interested in thinking about the ""whole person"" in Campus and Health contexts: the dynamic continuum along which the identities of learners, educators, patients, and health care providers, are not mutually exclusive. As Provost Kornbluth has commented, ""Beyond helping to train compassionate and humanistic health care providers and providing new therapeutic interventions, the health humanities can offer us novel, interdisciplinary ways of thinking about health and what it truly means to be 'well.'"" Co-sponsored by the Provost of Duke University, Sally Kornbluth, and the Chancellor of Duke Health, Eugene Washington, the FHI HHL is committed to facilitating collaborative innovations between practitioners and scholars in the humanities, arts, and interpretive social sciences, and their counterparts in the Health Sciences. The Franklin Humanities Institute is collaborating with a sister University Institute, the Duke Global Health Institute (DGHI), to situate this lab in a new crossroads of Campus and Health: Room 0037A in the Duke Global Health Institute (DGHI) at 310 Trent Drive. The FHI synergy with DGHI will facilitate new flows and interactions, including course cross-listings familiarizing Global Health students with humanities course options.

68	Prevention and Detection of Cervical Cancer through Self-Administered Screening in the Community	Huchko, Megan	United States		September 2016	Ongoing	Cervical cancer impacts over half a million women globally each year, with almost 90% of cases occuring in resource-limited settings. This is mainly due to the lack of population-based screening programs, which reduce the burden of disease in resource-replete settings through treatment of precancerous lesions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the cervical cancer disparity has worsened over the past twenty years due to the HIV epidemic, which increases the biologic risk for cervical cancer and has strained the already overburdened healthcare systems. In Uganda, the Ministry of Health has set an agenda for cervical cancer prevention over the next 5 years. The Ministry of Health recognizes that in addition to employing evidence-based screening and treatment techniques, the overall population impact of cervical cancer screening depends on two main factors: 1. community-wide access to screening and 2. successful linkage to treatment or follow-up for women who screen positive. Uganda's Strategic Plan for Cervical Cancer Control prioritizes the evaluation of implementation strategies for cervical cancer prevention as a key first step in addressing the burden of disease. In Project 2, we will evaluate a context-specific, community-based cervical cancer prevention program employing simple, low-cost screening and treatment techniques. Specifically, the program will provide cervical cancer screening with self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) specimens offered through community health campaigns. The program will also provide cryotherapy through mobile treatment teams working in the local communities to reduce the risk of invasive cancer in women who test positive for HPV. Ongoing evaluation of the program will allow the research team to iteratively adapt the activities to address individual- and community-level factors as well as processes that impact the uptake of screening and treatment. Our specific aims are to: 1. Establish the acceptance and correlates of self-collected HPV-RNA testing among women in the rural Ugandan community as well as the incidence and determinants of successful completion of the cervical cancer screening cascade from self-collected HPV testing to receipt of results 2, Ascertain the frequency and determinants of successful acquisition of treatment among women who have HPV detected on self-collected swabs in rural Uganda. 3. Derive population-based estimates of the prevalence of high-risk HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) detected through community-based screening employing self-collected HPV RNA testing in rural Uganda.

69	Evaluating a Community-Driven Cervical Cancer Prevention Strategy in Western Kenya	Huchko, Megan	United States,Kenya		September 2016	Ongoing	"Cervical cancer impacts over half a million women globally each year. While cervical cancer control in wealthy countries is one of the public health success stories of the past century, the disease remains a significant threat for women in developing countries where almost 90% of cases occur. Although effective screening technologies have been developed for use in low-resource settings, there are complicated, context-specific barriers to their implementation as part of a complete cervical cancer prevention strategy. In addition to employing evidence-based screening and treatment techniques, the overall population impact of cervical cancer screening depends on two main factors: 1. community-wide access to screening and 2. successful linkage to treatment or follow-up for women who screen positive. Strategies to address these factors must also be acceptable, relatively easy to implement, and cost-effective to be sustainable. Our formative work in western Kenya, a country with a high cervical cancer burden, uncovered tangible barriers and facilitators to these key steps in the ""cervical cancer prevention cascade"" and has led to a strategy that will increase women's uptake of cervical cancer prevention activities. Based on this work, we have developed the following hypotheses 1. cervical cancer screening with self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) specimens will reach more women when offered through community health campaigns versus government clinics; and 2. community-developed strategies will successfully link more women to treatment than the current standard of care (i.e., referral to treatment sites). To test these hypotheses, we will work with our local implementing partners, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and the RCTP-FACES NSO to carry out a two-phase cluster-randomized trial of implementation strategies for a Ministry of Health and WHO-recommended cervical cancer prevention protocol in western Kenya. During Phase 1, communities will be randomized to HPV-testing in either community-health campaigns or in clinics, with standard referral for treatment of HPV women to government facilities. We will use the RE-AIM framework, a framework used to evaluate implementation strategies, (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation consistency and costs, and Maintenance) to assess the key outcomes; we will then work in partnership with the community to develop a strategy for enhanced linkage to care. In Phase 2, all communities will offer community-based testing with enhanced linkage to care. Conducting this cluster-randomized trial will enable us to assess the proportion of women in each community who get cervical cancer screening, the gain in treatment access with enhanced linkage to care, and the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. The RE-AIM framework will allow us to measure and refine the context-specific dimensions of the project to produce a tool-kit for scale-up within this region and implementation into similar settings."

72	Impact of Sickle-Trait on Transcriptional Regulation in P. falciparum Parasites	Taylor, Steve	Mali		December 2016	Ongoing	Sickle-trait hemoglobin protects African children from severe-life threatening falciparum malaria, but the mechanisms of this protection are incompletely understood. Several lines of evidence support the notion that hemoglobin mutations disrupt the expression of parasite-derived proteins on the surface of the infected red blood cell (iRBC). These proteins on the iRBC surface mediate the pathogenicity of the parasite, and therefore identifying mechanisms by which their expression can be disrupted will offer new strategies to neutralize the parasite. In our preliminary experiments, sickle-trait dramatically alters the strong, periodic transcriptional program of P. falciparum as it matures within the RBC. More specifically, during early parasite maturation we observe consistent reductions in the expression of transcripts encoding parasite proteins that are essential for the organization and loading of Maurer's clefts, including MAHRP1 and 2, REX 1 and 2, and SBP1; these proteins are necessary for normal trafficking of other parasite proteins to the iRBC surface. Notably, sickle-trait did not reduce the expression of transcripts encoding either surface proteins (2013 including PfEMP1, KAHRP and other variant surface antigens 2013) or components of the parasite translocation machinery, suggesting that sickle-trait specifically attenuates the efficient loading of protein transport machinery. In this project, we propose to systematically compare transcriptomes of Plasmodium falciparum parasites growing in normal and sickle-trait RBCs in order to identify parasite gene expression networks that are disrupted by sickle-trait. We hypothesize that sickle-trait will produce early, pervasive aberrations in the expression of parasite transcripts encoding proteins necessary for the assembly of protein export machinery. To test this, we will first cultivate field and reference parasites in normal and sickle-trait RBCs, densely sample parasite transcriptomes during the asexual blood stage, and serially compute gene expression networks. Additionally, we will assay parasite transcriptomes collected from malarious Malian children and compare parasite gene expression in those with normal and sickle-trait RBCs. Through this project, we will directly identify upstream components of the parasite's protein export network that are inhibited by sickle-trait hemoglobin. Because sickle-trait serves as a model of attenuated parasite pathogenesis, these transcriptional profiles will be associated with clinical protection from malaria. The identification of transcripts and proteins that are impacted by sickle-trait will offer fresh targets for future interventions to neutralize the parasite.

75	Evaluation of Early Childhood Development Program for HIV-exposed Children in Cameroon		Cameroon		November 2016	Ongoing	There is substantial evidence that early childhood development (ECD) programming can improve child health and development outcomes. An important component of ECD programming is supporting positive parenting and early stimulation practices. While many parents could benefit from such programming, mothers that are HIV-infected may particularly benefit given the higher risks of poorer child development among HIV-exposed children. Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in Cameroon is implementing the Key Interventions to Develop Systems and Services (KIDSS) ECD program for HIV-exposed children. The program will include home-, facility-, and community-based components. This impact evaluation will ascertain to what extent the KIDSS home-based component of the ECD model affects attainment of age-appropriate developmental milestones (measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3 (ASQ-3)) in HIV-exposed children in Cameroon. The study design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with a cohort of 200 mother/child dyads across 10 study clinics. HIV mothers will be recruited during pregnancy and their children will be followed up until 18 months of age. The intervention group will receive regular home-based ECD services focused on positive parenting and early stimulation as well as exposure to facility- and community-based ECD programming. The control group will only have exposure to the facility- and community-based ECD programming. Randomization occurs at the clinic (cluster) level.

76	Planning Grant for Emerging Virus Research Training in Sierra Leone	Woods, Chris			November 2016	Ongoing	**Activity #1.** To develop and perform a needs assessment for clinical research training in viral emerging infectious diseases at the College of Medical and Allied Health Sciences in Sierra Leone. **Activity #2.** To undertake a preliminary assessment of local investigators to explore the feasibility of establishing a network of clinical research expertise in multiple locations that could rapidly respond to research needs in the event of an outbreak. **Activity #3.** To identify training programs and educational resources at Duke University that would benefit the clinical and epidemiologic research training needs at COMAHS.Following the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Sierra Leone College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences (COMAHS) and Duke University seek to develop a training program to advance research capacity for viral emerging infectious diseases. Building upon existing relationships with Sierra Leone investigators and leaders, as well as lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak, Duke University will work closely with colleagues at COMAHS to leverage expertise in infectious disease, medical and research training, extensive clinical research expertise and a strong commitment to global health equity in this effort. With receipt of this planning award, we will develop and perform a clinical research needs assessment in Sierra Leone; identify specific clinical research training opportunities at COMAHS that would benefit from Duke's support, experience, and training resources; and conduct a preliminary feasibility assessment of investigators, with the long term goal of increasing the research capacity throughout Sierra Leone. We will bring together the experience of the healthcare community in Sierra Leone and the multiple resources available throughout Duke University and Medical Center together with collaborating entities to create a combination of online and classroom-based didactic training opportunities, 'real-world' internship opportunities to observe how clinical research is conducted in various settings, and novel trial simulations in clinical research. This type of collaboration and preparation would help bring together and prepare the healthcare community in Sierra Leone, ultimately enabling their capacity to rapidly implement therapeutic or vaccine trials during a future outbreak. We believe this program is critical to empower West African communities to be able to participate more fully in responses to emerging viral epidemics.

In this project, we will use an innovative approach to identify the best strategy for adoption of the POCkeT Colposcope in a country-specific setting. This approach is the value chain analysis (VCA) framework, which uses a holistic, system-based approach to map the ecosystem of activities and actors involved in a given development project. VCA, a widely used tool in international economic development, is most recently being applied to social aspects of development, including healthcare. The framework is useful because it looks at the actors and activities in a sector or service, as well as the policies that help to promote delivery of these services to the target population, which is a critical step in the wide scale implementation of the screening technology. In this project, a diverse team of faculty, staff and students will map the various stakeholders involved in the implementation of the POCkeT Colposcope in Peru, one of the initial launch countries.

86	SHARE Child Pakistan	Turner, Elizabeth	United States		July 2016	Ongoing	Every year millions of children begin a compromised developmental trajectory resulting from exposure to maternal depression. In recent years, compelling evidence that maternal depression leads to worse developmental outcomes in the child has prompted a dramatic increase in efforts to ameliorate it. However, empirical evidence linking depression treatment to improved developmental trajectories in offspring is far from robust. The evidence is lacking due to several methodological limitations of previous studies, namely, insufficient follow-up, lack of appropriate control group, and/or lack of attention to the psychological and behavioral mechanisms underlying the impact of interventions on both the mother and child. The SHARE Child Pakistan study is an innovative study designed to study a cohort of more than 1000 children born in 2014-2016 in rural Pakistan, half born to perinatally depressed and half born to perinatally non-depressed mothers. We wish to determine what are the expected socio and emotional developmental trajectories of infants born to perinatally non-depressed mothers to use as an anchor point of comparison for those of perinatally depressed mothers. Similarly, we hope to determine whether the trajectories of infants whose perinatally depressed mothers participate in a cognitivebehavioral therapy program converge to those of the on-depressed mothers. This project will additionally help us to identify mediators of any pathways and to hopefully identify mechanisms that can be targeted in future studies. The work to be completed by the DGHI biostatistics team is essential for the success of the parent R01 grant. Specifically, Liz Turner will continue her role as faculty biostatistician and John Gallis his role as study biostatistician. We will continue with weekly meetings with the Pakistan team, with data processing, data preparation, the development of statistical analysis plans, the execution of statistical analyses, the development and writing of papers and with contributions to capacity building of our Pakistani collaborators.

91	Malaria chemoprevention in children with sickle cell anemia in Western Kenya	Taylor, Steve	Kenya		June 2016	Ongoing	Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk to suffer from malaria. Other high-risk groups in Africa -- including pregnant women and infants -- are administered intermittent preventive therapy with antimalarials to reduce the burden of malaria, but strategies to do so in SCA children are lacking. Currently, few strategies have been tested, and none with large sample sizes powered on clinically-important outcomes for malaria and SCA. In this project, we propose a three-arm, randomized, active-placebo clinical trial of malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens in children with SCA in Western Kenya. Capitalizing on the clinical trial expertise of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the global field research footprint of the Duke Global Health Institute, and existing collaborations with Moi University and partners in Western Kenya, we will enroll children with SCA in Homa Bay, Kenya, which is endemic for falciparum malaria. Children will be randomized to either daily Proguanil (current standard of care), monthly sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine-amodiaquine, or monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and followed for 12 months. The primary outcome will be the incidence of falciparum malaria, and other prespecified outcomes compared between allocation arms will be measures of SCA morbidity including painful events, dactylitis, and need for transfusion, measures of malaria severity, and hospitalizations and deaths. At the conclusion of the study, we expect to provide an evidence base for the use of two alternative strategies to protect children with SCA from malaria, and to potentially reduce the morbidity of SCA in malaria-endemic areas in Africa. These data will directly enable clinicians in Africa to improve the care of children with SCA.The ultimate goal of this study is to provide an evidence base for enhancing the supportive care of children with sickle cell anemia in sub-Saharan Africa.

94	Pregnant women as a sentinel group for malaria surveillance in an era of changing malaria transmission	Taylor, Steve	Mozambique		May 2016	Ongoing	Continued monitoring of malaria in pregnancy is lacking in most endemic settings, in spite of its significant disease burden. Increases in malaria-related harmful effects observed among Mozambican pregnant women after drastic malaria declines during the last decade [2] suggest that closely monitoring of the transmission is needed to quickly identify rebounds in adverse outcomes, especially in areas embarking in malaria elimination activities. Moreover, several evidences point to IgGs against VAR2CSA (the parasite antigen that mediates sequestration of P. falciparum in the placenta) as a marker of cumulative exposure to P. falciparum during pregnancy that can provide estimates of malaria transmission. We hypothesize that dynamics of malaria in pregnancy and pregnancy-specific immunity reflect changes in the intensity of transmission through location and time, not only among pregnant women but also in the underlying community. The goal of this study is to provide epidemiological, molecular and immunological insights of the value of pregnant women attending health facilities to generate estimates of malaria burden and its adverse consequences in situation of varying levels of malaria transmission, with the ultimate hope of developing new tools for the monitoring of malaria in endemic countries. To address this, we will conduct a three-year p study at three health facilities with different levels of malaria transmissin in Maputo Province to determine the relationship between malaria transmission, parasitological outcomes and the clinical impact of malaria infection in pregnant women at their first antenatal visit, delivery and during sick visits (Aim 1.1). Moreover, we will create a sample repository biobank for future investigations on host and parasite factors influencing malaria disease during pregnancy (Aim 1.2). We will also determine the relationship between malaria estimates obtained from pregnant women, children at hospital visits, (Aim 2.1) and seroprevalences against VAR2CSA (Aim 2.2). The impact of interrupting malaria transmission on pregnancy-specific serology (Aim 2.3) will be assessed in pregnant women from Magude after mass drug administration in the community. Finally, scientific capacity in the Manhiça Health Research Center (Aim 3) will be developed through training on a) epidemiological research and management of malaria data; b) molecular tools for detection of malaria parasites and molecular markers of antimalarial resistance for rapid mapping of drug resistance; and c) pregnancy- specific immunity as an innovative tool to assess malaria transmission. This study will contribute to promote a pregnancy malaria research agenda by improving our scientific knowledge on determinants of malaria susceptibility during pregnancy and demonstrating the feasibility and value of an easy-to-implement new generation serological tool for malaria surveillance in malaria elimination contexts.The primary outcome of my role in the project is the molecular surveillance of drug resistance markers in malaria parasites collected in pregnant women.

95	Postpartum HIV care engagement in the context of Option B+ in Tanzania	Watt, Melissa	Tanzania		April 2016	Ongoing	PIs: Melissa Watt and Blandina Mmbaga (KCMC, Tanzania)Funder: NIAID, R21, 2016-18Site: Moshi, TanzaniaUnder Option B+, the new approach for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) recommended by the World Health Organization and adopted by Tanzania, all HIV-infected pregnant women begin lifetime antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, regardless of clinical staging. This protocol holds great promise for improving women's long-term health and preventing forward transmission, but there are concerns about implementation challenges, particularly regarding women's engagement in care in the postpartum period. Longitudinal research in several African settings suggest that women are at high risk of HIV care drop-out in the postpartum period.The goal of the proposed study is to examine the implementation of Option B+ in three sites in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, to understand factors at both the facility and patient levels that support or obstruct women's engagement with HIV care following childbirth, and to identify opportunities to support the successful implementation of Option B+. This goal will be accomplished through three aims and related methods, based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.First, we will examine facility-level factors influencing postpartum care engagement. Methods will include clinical observations to understand process of implementation, 30 key informant interviews to explore provider perspectives and experiences, and review of 512 patient records to document care engagement outcomes.Second, we will examine patient-level factors influencing post-partum care engagement. Methods will include a cohort of 200 HIV-infected women, enrolled during pregnancy and followed at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum to identify predictors of postpartum HIV care engagement, and qualitative in-depth interviews with a subset of 24 women to provide further context to the data.Third, we will identify opportunities to improve implementation of Option B+ so that it enhances and promotes postpartum HIV care. Methods will include 9 focus group discussions with providers and patients, and a stakeholder forum to share and discuss the study findings.The proposed study will address the critical need to support engagement with lifelong ART for women beyond the pregnancy period, and therefore support the success of the Option B+ protocol for improving the coverage of ART in high-infection, low-resource settings. Through multi-methods data collection and triangulation across stakeholders, the study has the potential to uncover innovative implementation solutions, which can be further refined and tested in a multi-site intervention trial. Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) in Moshi, Tanzania is well positioned to lead an implementation science study on this topic. The NIH and PEPFAR have made strategic investments at KCMC to develop its capacity as a research center of excellent, including funding from five NIH institutes, and MEPI and AITRP capacity-building awards. This study will build upon those investments to further strengthen KCMC's capacity to conduct meaningful implementation science research in Tanzania.Enrollment for this study is complete, with data collection and analysis underway.Project website: https://sites.duke.edu/pmtct/	Health policy and systems,HIV/AIDS,Maternal, adolescent and child health	NIH-National Institute of Child Health and Human Development	Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre

97	Antibody responses to Zika Virus infection and fetal outcome in a cohort of pregnant women in Brazil	Permar, Sallie	Brazil		April 2016	Ongoing	The World Health Organization recently declared the Zika Virus (ZKV) epidemic that began in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread to surrounding countries in the Americas and Caribbean an international public health emergency. The most concerning feature of this global epidemic, which is primarily being spread by the Aedes species of mosquitos, is its association with fetal brain damage in Brazilian infants, manifesting as microcephaly. The link between maternal ZKV infection and fetal brain damage has been strengthened by a number of cases in which ZKV has been identified in the amniotic fluid, placenta, and tissues of affected maternal/fetal pairs. Thus, it is a global priority to rapidly develop strategies for prevention of maternal infection, primarily a maternal ZKV vaccine that can protect women from ZKV infection and/or the associated fetal disease. Yet, the lack of understanding of the natural maternal immune responses to ZKV infection and how they relate to fetal outcome will impede vaccine development. As virus-specific antibodies are often critical for protection against virus acquisition and are passed to the fetus during late pregnancy, we hypothesize that the magnitude and potency of the maternal antibody response against ZKV is indirectly associated with the severity of congenital ZKV infection. Understanding the relationship between maternal antibody responses, in utero virus transmission, and fetal outcome is critical to defining the immunologic roadmap for a maternal ZKV vaccine.

98	A pilot study to estimate the impact of mPango on contraceptive use	Green, Eric	Kenya		April 2016	Ongoing	Maternal mortality is a persistent challenge for the Kenyan health system. In 2015, the UN projects that 8,000 Kenyan women will die during pregnancy or in the first 42 days after childbirth. Meeting women's unmet need for family planning could prevent a substantial number of these deaths. While there is an active marketplace for family planning products and services in Kenya, there is also tremendous room for growth. Nearly 2 million Kenyan women are not using contraception but say they would like to, and millions of others are either unaware of the potential benefits, misinformed about the full range of modern methods available, or unsatisfied with previous experiences using contraception. mPango is a new social venture that recognizes the potential of voluntary family planning and the great opportunity that exists in Kenya. We are weeks away from launching a digital marketplace that will educate callers about family planning, offer free automated counseling, recommend suitable methods, and make referrals to local providers. We propose to conduct a pilot study using a randomized encouragement design to estimate the impact of Nivi on the uptake of contraception among women with an unmet need for family planning.

99	Impact of El Nino on Environmental Mercury and Human Exposure	Pan, William	Peru		April 2016	Ongoing	Beginning in November 2015, Peru will experience one of the largest El Niño climate events on record. Scientists have historically focused on studying impacts from El Niño in coastal areas due to relatively dry regions experiencing large-scale flooding. Research has largely overlooked the effects of El Niño in the Amazon and its consequences for human health beyond vector-borne disease risk. The Madre de Dios (MDD) region of the Peruvian Amazon is expected to face a challenging El Niño season with over 90% of the population experiencing both excessive drought and flooding. These environmental changes are coupled with an ongoing social challenge: artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) that has rapidly expanded due to construction of the Interoceanic Highway. ASGM releases inorganic mercury (Hg) directly into proximate soil and river sediment, where anaerobic bacteria bio-methylate Hg to form the potent neurotoxicant methylmercury (MeHg) that biomagnifies in the aquatic food web. Communities near and far downstream from ASGM are exposed to high levels of MeHg via consumption of contaminated fish. Our primary hypothesis is that El Niño is associated with increased human MeHg exposure due to elevated rates of Hg bio-methylation in aquatic ecosystems and increased fish consumption. We hypothesize that: (1) El Niño will disrupt agricultural production, leading to increased reliance on fish protein; (2) Hg released into the environment by ASGM will undergo more rapid bio-methylation due to higher bacterial activity in sediment caused by El Niñorelated flooding; (3) fish in flooded rivers downstream from ASGM and sold in markets will contain higher levels of MeHg; and (4) environmental Hg exposures in adults, children, and developing fetuses will increase with higher dietary exposure and nutritional vulnerability. We will develop a predictive model for human internal MeHg dose that accounts for El Niño-related environmental changes. Our team is uniquely positioned to evaluate the impact of El Niño in the Amazon by leveraging ongoing research in MDD with prior data collected on Hg levels in environmental and human biological samples. In addition, we leverage our long-term collaborative partnerships with community leaders and the Ministry of Health to assist in implementation of our aims. To test our hypotheses, we will collect additional primary data by testing fish, sediment and human biological samples for Hg and other metals in areas and people previously sampled by our team during and following El Niño, conduct monthly food frequency surveys in sentinel households (previously sampled), and initiate a birth cohort (enrolling 10 children per month). Results from this proposed study will help establish whether El Niño flooding is associated with increased MeHg exposure, identify sources of exposures, and determine exposure thresholds associated with observable health effects among persons living in the Amazon. As El Niño events occur regularly and are projected to intensify in the future, this project has significant potential to inform future disaster preparedness and to protect the wellbeing of vulnerable regional populations.

100	mHealth in China	LeGrand, Sara	China		February 2016	Ongoing	In many countries around the world, men who have sex with men (MSM) experience stigma, discrimination and violence due to their sexual minority status and are at an increased risk for psychological distress, mental health disorders, suicidal ideation, suicide and substance use disorders. Although little research has been conducted on the mental health status of MSM in China, existing studies have found high rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Mental health services have been found to significantly improve mental health outcomes among MSM in China, however utilization of services remains extremely low. In order to achieve this objective, we will conduct an online survey with 300 MSM to assess mental health status, factors contributing to mental health status, mental health treatment utilization, and preferences for interventions that could help MSM improve mental health outcomes. The online survey will assess the following: depression, anxiety, traumatic experiences, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, sexual minority stigma (perceived, experienced, internalized), social support (including friends and family), identity conflict, violence, self-esteem, demographic characteristics (marital status, age, sexual orientation, migrant status, time living in Chongqing, etc.), and mental health service availability, utilization and preferences. Scales that have been translated and used in other studies with MSM in China will be included when possible. There is a pressing need to understand factors contributing to poor mental health among MSM and develop interventions that improve mental health outcomes for this highly marginalized population. The objective of this study is to determine the mental health status of MSM living in Chongqing, factors contributing to mental health status, mental health treatment utilization, and preferences for interventions that could improve mental health outcomes among MSM.

103	POCkeT Colposcope in Mombasa, Kenya	Ramanujam, Nimmi	Kenya		January 2016	Ongoing	A novel POCkeT Colposcope has been developed by Nimmi Ramanujam to improve access to colposcopy. The POCkeT Colposcope can be constructed using relatively low-cost materials and collects high-quality digital images that can be easily transmitted for external colposcopic review. Researchers at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health (Smith J), Duke University Medical Center (Ramanujam N), the University of Washington (McClelland S), and the University of Nairobi, Kenya (Mugo N), are collaborating on a new pilot study to assess the POCkeT Colposcope’s clinical validity. This study, funded by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, will first assess concordance of Kenyan colposcopist readings of previously collected paired images obtained by the POCkeT Colposcope and by a conventional colposcope for cases of different known grades of histologically confirmed pathology. Researchers will then collect new images from a population of 200 high-risk women in Mombasa, Kenya, to assess POCkeT Colposcope clinical performance compared to conventional colposcopy for the detection of high-grade precancerous lesions. This pilot study will produce preliminary data to inform the development of a future large-scale validation study.	Health care access,Cancer,Engineering		UNC Chapel Hill	
104	Developing a direct observational measure of family functioning for low-resource settings: Establishing reliability and validity in a Kenyan sample	Puffer, Eve	Kenya		January 2016	Ongoing	Family environments can be powerful risk or protective factors for the mental health outcomes of children and adolescents, making family-based interventions important for prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. A major barrier to conducting rigorous trials of family interventions in low- and middle-income countries is the lack of tools for assessing family functioning. Based on a previous qualitative study, we have developed a direct observational tool to assess family interaction patterns. In the assessment, families participate in structured activities that are videotaped and coded on multiple categories of family functioning. In this application, we propose assessing the criterion validity of this tool by comparing its results with results of in-depth interviews with the families in this study. Participants will include 200 families with a target child between 10 and 17 years of age. Children and caregivers will be administered the interview, observational measure, and survey measures that will be validated concurrently. The expected outcome is a direct observational measure of family functioning that is feasible and validated in a low-resource setting. If results support validity, a second objective of the study is to manualize all materials, including procedures, the coding system, training materials, and adaptation guidelines to facilitate testing of the measure in other contexts.The observational tool developed in this study will be designed for use in clinical practice for identifying families in need of intervention.

105	Application of Integrated Strategy with Community-based Approaches and Strengthening Health System to Control Malaria Effectively in the Southern Tanzania	Kramer, Randall	United States		December 2015	Ongoing	The OP4 project is piloting a program targeting improved access to and capacity of health care services in two study areas in rural Tanzania towards the end goal of lessening the burden of malaria in the study areas as well as yielding broader lessons for potential replicability and scale-up in the future. The project will draw on the historical experiences of China's malaria control initiatives to inform the strategies implemented in this pilot project. The overall aim of the pilot project is to achieve at least a 30% reduction in malaria-related morbidity and mortality in the targeted study areas as well as build local capacity in malaria control. This overall objective will be pursued through the specific objectives of the project, which are stated in the proposal as follows: a. To increase the parasitological examination rate of suspected malaria cases at community-based health facilities in the pilot areas. b. To reduce morbidity and mortality by improving malaria case management including the appropriate treatment of confirmed and unconfirmed malaria cases in the pilot areas. c. To establish a platform for entomological and parasitological surveillance as well as information reporting. d. To assess implementation of the WHO T3 strategy integrated with Chinese experiences. Through pursuing these objectives, the project also expects to achieve broader improvements in capacity of local health care services and personnel. The role of the Duke Global Health Institute is focused on: 1) providing consultation on the baseline household survey, 2) technical reporting on the mid-term external evaluation, and 3) overall collaboration on the project and manuscripts.The main issues to be addressed through the project are to summarize the relevant experiences and lessons from China's malaria control activities applicable to the pilot study areas, to sesign a malaria prevention and control strategy reflective of the local context, and to adapt the local strategy to accommodate and capitalize on local infrastructure and resources. It is anticipated that the project will also yield broader lessons for potential replicability and scale-up in the future.

106	Supporting Commissioned Research through Healthy Eating Research	Story, Mary	United States		December 2015	Ongoing	The Healthy Eating Research (HER) program funds scientifically rigorous, solution-oriented proposals from investigators representing diverse disciplines and backgrounds. This research examines the influence of the most potent, modifiable environmental and policy factors to reduce obesity in children, focusing on youth ages 0 to 18 and their families, with a special emphasis on high-risk, lower-income, and racial and ethnic minority populations. Findings are expected to advance RWJF's efforts to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic and help all children achieve a healthy weight. In addition to traditional grant making, HER commissions strategic, timely research products such as small-scale studies and analyses, research reviews, issue briefs, papers, and expert panels. These products and activities aid in building the evidence base and supplying information needed to practitioners, advocates, policymakers, and other decision-makers. With this grant, HER will fund commissioned research on environmental and policy strategies with strong potential to promote healthy eating among children to prevent childhood obesity with a specific focus on underserved, lower-income and racial/ ethnic minority children and their families. We anticipate commissioning 10-14 studies at $15,000-$75,000 each as well as several research projects and products at smaller dollar amounts. Funded studies will be for duration of up to twelve months. Deliverables vary and may include a report, manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals, white papers, reports with recommendations, webinars, research and policy briefs, and stakeholder convenings with consensus-based recommendations. Key partners and consultants will be engaged in this work and research findings will be disseminated strategically, in coordination with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to rapidly and effectively convey research findings and products funded through this grant to key audiences and stakeholders (e.g. public health and community advocates, policymakers, community leaders, minority service organizations, other researchers, the media, and the public), as well as to engage them up front to assure high relevance and applicability of HER's research agenda. HER will continue to promote and drive traffic to the program's website and to continue to develop a robust social media strategy to complement research dissemination activities. Success will be measured in a number of ways, including providing timely evidence to help inform RWJF on issues relevant to the Foundation's policy priorities; through outside evaluation activities; and via a variety of research dissemination metrics which can be gleaned from HER's website, email distribution lists, and social media.

107	Bloodborne tropical pathogen detection using multiple nanophotonic arrays	Taylor, Steve	United States,Kenya		November 2015	November 2017	In tropical settings, the diagnosis of infectious etiologies of fever remains challenging, owing to the complex epidemiology of parasitic, viral, fungal, and bacterial causes and the suboptimal performance of current diagnostics. Multiplex molecular pathogen detection systems are now routinely used in the developed world to interrogate respiratory and blood specimens, and there remains an ongoing need for simple, rapid, multiplex, and sensitive platforms for point-of-care diagnostics for tropical pathogens. In this project, a novel nanophotonic, PCR-free, incubationindependent, sequence-based detection platform for bloodborne tropical pathogens that cause fever will be developed and field-tested. Specifically, in the initial R21 phase, a multiplex nanophotonic chip based upon plasmonic 'nano-rattles' will be designed and engineered that can detect unamplified nucleic acid targets in two species of malaria parasites, dengue and chikungunya viruses, spotted fever group Rickettsia, and Leptospira interrogans, and its operating characteristics will be quantified by comparison with reference diagnostics using banked field samples from Kenya, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka. Upon achievement of transition milestones based upon these operating characteristics, in the R33 phase, the assay will be further developed by 1) engineering and building an integrated testing unit suitable for field use, and 2) deploying the assay for pathogen detection in prospective cohorts of febrile patients at field sites in western Kenya and western Thailand. The overall goal of this project is to produce a field-ready diagnostic system which sensitively and simultaneously detects 6 major bloodborne tropical pathogens in unprocessed whole blood specimens. To achieve this, this proposal is submitted by co-PIs with expertise in nanoplasmonics, bioassay development, optical sensing, tropical medicine, and epidemiology, and partners with collaborators in molecular diagnostics and tropical clinical research. This interdisciplinary team of investigators is committed to improving molecular diagnostics for tropical pathogens in order to improve the clinical care of patients with fever in the tropics and enhance the ability to track and detect emerging tropical diseases.The ultimate goal of this Phased Innovation Award is to enhance the diagnosis of tropical bloodborne pathogens in the clinic.

108	Through a child's eyes: Technological solutions to improve early child development in low resource settings	Kohrt, Brandon	Nepal,South Africa		November 2015	Ongoing	Early childhood is a critical period in human development. 1 Delayed or interrupted early development resulting from impoverished nutritional, educational, emotional and cognitive environments results in risks for diminished human capital, ill health, and psychosocial maladjustment in adulthood. 2-5 Evidence suggests that caregivers' behaviours can lead to differential neurocognitive development early in life with large differences in language and memory development evident before two years of age. 5 For example, differences in patterns of speech between mother and child can result in a cascade of effects that are directly relevant to a child's cortical development during early life. 6,7 Early childhood deprivation in these domains is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. 4,5 We hypothesize that by providing caregivers in low-resource settings with insight into the world as seen through the eyes of their children that caregiver investment can be enhanced in activities predictive of linguistic and cognitive development. Providing this insight for caregivers will be based on leveraging environmental and activity sensing technology to obtain behavioural data on caregiver-child interaction and monitoring parameters in the child's environment - an approach that contrasts with traditional methods relying predominantly on limited observational and self-report data. 8,9 We envision collecting data with low-cost sensing equipment, such as activity bracelets or audio sensing, that can be introduced unobtrusively into the child's environment. By harnessing technology as a tool to increase caregiver insight into a child's world, we hope to enhance caregiver investment to offset the environmental adversity to which children growing up in low resource environments are exposed.The project will result in guidelines for community health workers to implement mHealth technologies.

112	Developing evidence-based recommendations for promoting nutrition and healthy feeding patterns for children from birth through 24 months	Story, Mary	United States	http://www.healthyeatingresearch.org	October 2015	Ongoing	Feeding practices and patterns during the first two years of life are important for nutrition, both physical and cognitive growth and development, and establishing the foundation for healthy eating habits. With more than one quarter of U.S. children overweight or obese by the time they enter kindergarten there is an urgent need and an important window of opportunity to establish healthy dietary behaviors early in life. Healthy Eating Research (HER) proposes to convene an expert panel focused on identifying best nutrition and feeding practices for infants and toddlers, with an emphasis on healthy eating, dietary quality, portion sizes, and mealtime environment. The panel will be comprised of roughly 12-14 health professionals from a variety of backgrounds such as nutrition, pediatrics, family medicine, child development, psychology, nursing, pediatric dentistry, and others who have expertise in nutrition and feeding practices, and growth and development for infants and toddlers. Recommendations resulting from this panel will be a critical resource to federal, state, and local policymakers in future efforts to draft and implement policies aimed at reducing overweight and obesity in early childhood.

Sikkema and Seth Kalichman (University of Connecticut)Investigators: Melissa WattFunder: NIAAA, R01, 2008-2014Site: Cape Town, South AfricaThis study, conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, aimed to understand women's HIV risks in the context of alcohol-serving establishments in one urban township. The data included in-depth qualitative interviews with a range of stakeholders, repeated cross-sectional surveys of venue patrons, and a longitudinal cohort of women who frequent the study venues. 12 distinct venues were selected for involvement in the study. Over four time points in one year, 2,783 patrons completed the surveys, and a cohort of 560 women were followed longitudinally.An overarching theme among this population was the presence of poor mental health, particularly PTSD and depression, coupled with HIV risk behaviors and high alcohol consumption. The team has published over a dozen papers, both quantitative and qualitative, examining issues such as mental health, alcohol use, traumatic experiences, and food insecurity. Outcomes indicate a large presence of substance use among this population, particularly heavy alcohol consumption and use of methamphetamine. Both qualitative and quantitative data point to the pervasive practice of gender-based violence, sometimes facilitated by the venue atmosphere. Specifically, forced sex and other traumatic experiences were endorsed by the majority of women.	HIV/AIDS,Substance use,Violence	NIH-National Institute of Mental Health	Stellenbosch University	
117	Developing a Brief Negotiational Intervention for Alcohol in Moshi, Tanzania	Staton, Catherine	Tanzania		September 2015	Ongoing	"Globally, alcohol causes over 1.8 million deaths annually. In fact, for individuals 15-49 years of age, high-risk alcohol use is the leading disease-attributed risk factor for death. In high-income countries, a brief negotiational interview administered in an Emergency Department cost-effectively reduces alcohol related harm. Unfortunately, in low and middle-income countries, alcohol use is rapidly increasing, but factors influencing alcohol use and approaches to reduce alcohol related harm are largely unknown. This career development award would provide me the dedicated research time, research skills and funding to fill this gap. With partners in Tanzania, I have shown that 30% of patients presenting with injuries to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) Emergency Department (ED) had consumed alcohol prior to their injury. By definition, these patients are deemed ""harmful alcohol users"" with very high risk of repeated alcohol-related harm. Based on high-income setting data, hazardous or 'at-risk' and harmful alcohol users would benefit from an intervention -- a brief negotiational interview -- to reduce alcohol use and harm. Therefore, I propose to develop and test a culturally-appropriate brief negotiational interview in Tanzania. The intervention, utilizing motivational interviewing principles, will be a one-time, 15-minute, practitioner-led discussion of safe drinking behaviors, and negotiation of changes in alcohol use. I will test the intervention in the KCMC ED for patients presenting with an alcohol related consequence or injury during what is known as a ""teachable moment."" My central hypothesis is that a brief negotiational interview administered in the KCMC ED will decrease high-risk alcohol use as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Tool (AUDIT). Utilizing my existing experience and what I will gain through the proposed mentorship and education in mixed methods research, motivational interviewing, implementation research, and global clinical trials, I will prepare the tools required to conduct a pragmatic clinical trial to test this hypothesis. **Aim1:** Define patients, families and healthcare providers' current perspectives on alcohol use. Using surveys and focus groups with patients, family members, and healthcare providers, I will define current alcohol use practices and obstacles to alcohol reduction. To successfully complete this aim, I will seek education on focus group and survey methods to augment my quantitative data skills. I will analyze the data explaining how and why alcohol impacts KCMC patients' lives. **Aim 2:** Develop a culturally-appropriate nurse-delivered brief negotiational interview (BNI) utilizing motivational interviewing, to be delivered in the KCMC Emergency Department. We will iteratively develop and improve a BNI in order to ensure adherence to the widely accepted %u2018FRAMES' model of motivational interviewing. Then, we will validate our outcome tools. To reach this aim, I will gain knowledge in motivational interviewing principles, Swahili language training, and mentorship in protocol development for BNIs testing in Swahili. **Aim 3:** Conduct a pilot trial of the intervention. Feasibility of study procedures, patient acceptability of the intervention and trial, and patient enrollment and retention will be tested in a pilot randomized pragmatic clinical trial. During this aim, I will have mentorship and didactics on global clinical trials, implementation research, and grant writing."

118	Addressing High Risk Alcohol Use Amongst Injury Patients in an Emergency Department in Tanzania	Staton, Catherine	United States,Tanzania		September 2015	Ongoing	Annually, there are 1.8 million global deaths due to alcohol. Alcohol use is rapidly increasing in low and middle-income countries, where it is inexpensive, readily available, poorly regulated, and there are few resources devoted to safe alcohol use behavior. Like many other limited resource settings, there are few treatment facilities or addiction practitioners in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. This career development award will allow for the cultural adaptation, validation, and pilot testing of a brief negotiational interview for alcohol use. To do so, the project will 1. describe the current knowledge and perceptions about alcohol use in Tanzania, 2. adapt an evidence-based intervention to the Tanzanian setting and, 3. pilot this intervention in preparation of a large-scale trial. The intervention, a brief negotiational interview, based on a motivational interviewing framework, has proven effective in the US but has not been adapted or implemented in an African context. I am uniquely qualified to lead this project given my 10 years of clinical and research global health experience. I am dedicated to a global health research career, am integrated into the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center community, and have conducted the basic alcohol epidemiology research in preparation for this award. To become an independent researcher focusing on addressing alcohol use, I am seeking further skills in mixed methods research, motivational interviewing, global clinical trials, and the responsible conduct of research. This proposal not only provides me with a unique combination of research expertise that are needed in Africa, but also lays a foundation for groundbreaking research to curb the impact of alcohol use in Africa.

119	Swine Influenza Virus Transmission in Confined Animal Feeding Operations, China		China		August 2015	Ongoing	With its dense interacting populations of people, pigs, and poultry, China has been implicated as the source of the 1957 and 1968 pandemic influenza viruses and considered an epicenter for generating novel influenza virus strains. As industrialized farming has increased in China, the prevalence and variety of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have increased. In this controlled, 5-yr project, we will collaborate with leading Chinese infectious disease researchers and employ a One Health approach (human, animal, and environment) to study SIV transmission in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in mainland China. We will select CAFOs with a high prevalence of SIVs and prospectively follow the swine workers and their pigs, as well as examine the CAFO environment as a source for SIV persistence and transmission. In this collaboration, our aims are: 1) to identify and characterize enzootic and emergent SIVs, 2) to employ aerosol, fecal, environmental swabs, and water sampling to identify environmental areas with a high prevalence of SIVs, 3) to identify occupational risk factors for SIV infection, and 4) to identify serological and mucosal immunity biomarkers of protection against prevalent and emergent SIVs. This One Health approach to zoonotic influenza virus research is unique and made possible by our Chinese collaborators who have unique access to their swine production industry.

121	Improving the Health of South African Women with Traumatic Stress in HIV Care		South Africa		June 2015	Ongoing	PI: Kathleen J. SikkemaCo-PI: John Joska (University of Cape Town)Investigator: Melissa WattFunder: NIMH, R34, 2014-2017Site: Cape Town, South AfricaHIV-infected women in South Africa report high rates of sexual trauma (both childhood and adulthood experiences). Women with sexual trauma histories have poorer mental health and may have unique challenges fully engaging with HIV care. In South Africa, trauma treatment has not been well-integrated into the HIV care setting. Therefore, addressing the sequelae of sexual trauma among women within the context of HIV clinical care in South Africa can potentially improve the well-being of this patient population and also increase their engagement across the continuum of HIV treatment to reduce the forward transmission of HIV.In this three-year study, we developed and pilot tested Improving AIDS Care after Trauma (ImpACT), a brief intervention based on theories of stress, coping, and evidence-based treatment for traumatic stress. ImpACT was developed using an iterative process to culturally adapt a cognitive-behavioral intervention for delivery to women newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the South African clinical setting. Feedback from key informant interviews, in-depth interviews, and a trial run helped refine session content and the adaptation of key intervention elements.ImpACT was evaluated for feasibility and potential efficacy in a public clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, with a pilot intervention trial enrolling 64 participants. In exploratory analysis of primary outcomes, ImpACT participants, compared to Standard of Care, reported greater reductions in avoidance and arousal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and greater increases in ART adherence motivation at 3 months. Clinically significant decreases in overall PTSD symptoms were also demonstrated at 3 months. These effects continued as trends at the 6-month assessment, in addition to increases in social/spiritual coping. A trauma-focused, culturally-adapted individual intervention delivered by a non-specialist in the HIV care setting is feasible and acceptable. Preliminary findings suggest ImpACT has potential to reduce PTSD symptoms and increase ART adherence motivation, but a more intensive intervention may be needed to improve and maintain care engagement among this population. Outcomes are published in AIDS and Behavior.Future research goals include evaluating the effectiveness and exploring the scalability of ImpACT+ (a six-session, individual-level coping intervention, refined based on the pilot trial of ImpACT) in a full-scale trial.

124	Culturally Appropriate Screening and Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer in East Africa	Ramanujam, Nimmi	Kenya,Tanzania,Peru,India		April 2015	Ongoing	Cervical cancer affects the lives of 500,000 women worldwide each year, and results in more than 270,000 deaths. More than 75% of cervical cancer incidence occurs in Africa, of which East Africa has the highest. In East Africa, and in particular, Tanzania Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing (highly sensitive) or the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear (highly specific) screening is not available. Thus, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is used to screen the general female population at a primary health care setting, and VIA followed by cryotherapy or Loop Electrosurgical Procedure (LEEP) is performed at secondary (district and regional hospitals) and tertiary hospitals, VIA does not require specimen collection or processing like the Pap smear or HPV test, which makes it particularly appealing for use in this setting. In the U.S., VIA with magnification (VIAM) is performed using a low power microscope, called the colposcope, in women who have already been screened and found to have positive Pap smears. Magnification (4-7X) is used to visualize subtle features on the cervix, which is exposed with the aid of a speculum. However, the cost of the colposcope (U.S. $10K-$20K) makes its use in Tanzania prohibitive. VIA therefore is performed without magnification at the primary and secondary health settings and the interpretation of VIA is subjective. The problem with implementing VIA at the primary health setting is that health worker density in Tanzania is dire at 1 physician per 45,000 persons and 1 community health worker per 2,800 persons. Further, the training required for the community health worker to do a speculum based exam and interpretation of what he/she sees requires as much as $30 per woman with uneven results, leading to greater number of women that are overcalled as VIA positive. Further, there are well-documented studies that show that women in Tanzania fear the speculum and loss of privacy in a cervical exam. The goal of this Academic-Industry Partnership is for PI, Dr. Nimmi Ramanujam to work in partnership with Zenalux Biomedical to bring a two-pronged cervical cancer culturally relevant screening program that will facilitate scaling of population wide screening and sustainability of see and treat programs in East Africa.

127	Surveillance for Use of Healthcare Services among Residents in Jiangsu Province		China	https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/sites/default/files/u587/Jiangsu%20project.pdf	March 2015	Ongoing	"**Background:** The improvement of the population's health conditions is determined not only by the investment level and allocative efficiency of health resources, but also by effective utilization of health services by residents. Effective utilization of health services is defined as the number of health services utilized by those demanding it. Results are mutually constrained owing to the interaction between requisite amounts of population health services and the supply of health resources. However, currently, there is an unequal relationship between the supply and utilization of health services, representing the major discrepancy between data reported by the medical health institutions and the data from the population investigation. The National Health Services Survey (NHSS) has been done at 5-year intervals since 1993 in China, which is an important medium for providing healthcare information of Chinese population. It objectively reflects the achievements and problems during the creation and development of the health service. It also has the potential to predict the changing trends of both demand and utilization of health services. However, the investigation did not reflect the behaviors of health service utilization as expected. The first reason for this is that there is a five-year gap between each National Health Service investigation. This time window is too long, such that it cannot reflect the dynamic trend of the service utilization behavior with sufficient granularity. Therefore, the data cannot justify the need for service development during the time window. Second, the National Health Service investigation is a comprehensive investigation manipulated on a national level. The research and implementation plan to monitor residents' health service utilization behaviors are parts of the investigation. These are unlikely to be adequately specific and detailed. In addition, it is difficult for the investigation to comprehensively reflect the situation and changing trend of the residents' health service utilization behaviors. Moreover, according to recent literature, differences exist among residents' health service utilization behaviors because of different social statuses and income levels. However, regardless of the aspects, degrees, and factors that characterize this difference, there are no broadly accepted empirical investigations or systematic analyses recognized by the Health Administrative Departments or the academia. **Research Question:** What are the health service utilization behaviors among the residents in both rural and urban area? How to explore the methods to monitor health service utilization behaviors? **Aims:** 1. By monitoring health service utilization behaviors, we can thoroughly understand information about residents' treatment processes and actions toward diseases, utilization situations and impact factors of the health services, medical expenses, and reimbursement levels, etc. At the same time, to explore and optimize the methods to monitor health service utilization behaviors; 2. Dynamically tracking the behaviors of health service utilization, then analyzing and predicting the changing trend of residents' health service utilization, can provide fast and precise information for deepening the reform of the medical and health systems' planning and evaluation in the ""12th Five-year Plan"", and overall health resources planning in the ""13th Five-year Plan""; 3. to accelerate effective utilization of medical health resources, promote development of health management in a more elaborate direction, improve management ability, and overall further satisfy health requirements from residents.The first phase (3 months) field work was done and the report was developed and submitted to the National Health and Family Planning Commission. The second phase (4 months) is in progress. Several manuscripts are under development.The project tries to provide current and accurate information for deepening the reform of health systems' planning and evaluation; If the approach of monitoring is proven effective, it can accelerate effective utilization of health resources, promote development of health management in a more elaborate direction, improve management ability, and overall further satisfy health needs of residents."

128	Traffic and Trauma in India	Solomon, Harris	United States,India		March 2015	Ongoing	"Each day in Mumbai, nearly 7 people die on the city's municipal train system, as their feet become stuck in gaps between the platform and the train, or their bodies lean out the train's open doors and slam into poles. From January to April 2014, for instance, 682 commuters died in accidents -- a rise compared to previous years attributed to increased crowding. Meanwhile, on the city's clogged roads, motorbikes weave through traffic and often collide with cars, pedestrians, trucks, and even persons sleeping on the side of the road. As a result, India is among global leaders in traffic-related injuries, but beyond limited epidemiological data, social science research has yet to adequately engage this lethal phenomenon. While traffic has been studied in urban anthropology as a problem for urban development and politics, the proposed research instead studies traffic as a problem that manifests in bodies. Further, while medical anthropology has studied traumatic injuries as a bodily effect, this project studies traffic itself as both process and effect. The objective for this CAREER proposal is thus to analyze how urban infrastructures and bodies interrelate through the case study of traffic injuries. This objective will ground ethnographic research by the PI in India, based in Mumbai, which examines the ways that roads and railways work as the contexts, causes, and consequences of bodily injury. This objective will also ground educational efforts at Duke University, including course development and student-led research on car culture at Duke and in Durham. Over the course of the 5-year project period, the PI will study traffic injuries from three perspectives. First, the PI will conduct community-based study of commuting practices and experiences of traffic-related injuries. Second, he will conduct observations at trauma wards of 2 local hospitals, to understand how traffic injuries are understood and acted upon in healthcare settings. Third, he will interview experts in traffic science (such as engineers and urban planners) to understand how traffic injuries become a problem for urban officials to solve. The educational activities component of this CAREER proposal involves two activities to be based in Durham, NC that will be symmetrically integrated with the PI's research in Mumbai. The first activity is course development by the PI for his undergraduate and graduate teaching, which will elaborate key concepts relevant to the project in concert with the PI's general teaching responsibilities in Cultural Anthropology and Global Health. Second, the PI will lead a team of student researchers on a ""Car Cultures"" project at Duke and in Durham. This team of students will use qualitative methods to study the cultural meanings and values attributed to cars on campus, mobility patterns of students in the Durham area, and perspectives on mobility from North Carolina traffic officials and Emergency Medical System response personnel. They will meet frequently and develop and monitor their project in various symposia and workshops. Their research will elucidate the contexts, causes, and consequences of traffic and traffic injuries in a site in the US, allowing for comparison between the Mumbai and Durham case studies. Grounded in two different settings, the PI's research in India and the student research in the US will identify and elaborate overlaps and gaps, with the aim of expanding a cross-cultural understanding of traffic and traffic-related injuries. Per NSF CAREER requirements, the educational component of this overall project will be evaluated on two fronts: by the PI in Year 3, and by an independent student evaluator in Year 5."

134	Bridging income generation with provision of incentives for care (BIGPIC)	Bloomfield, Gerald	Kenya	http://www.ampathkenya.org/media/73459/bigpic_handout_v4_ampath_lores.pdf	July 2015	Completed	Bridging Income Generation with Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world. Diabetes, a major risk factor for CVD, is increasingly prevalent and responsible for substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Elevated blood pressure (BP) increases CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and pre-diabetes; BP control is therefore a powerful way to reduce CVD risk. Cost-effective, context-specific, and culturally appropriate interventions are critical, and both group medical visits and micro finance have the potential to achieve this. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership has expanded its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include diabetes and hypertension, and has piloted group care and micro finance initiatives with promising early results. However, the effectiveness of these strategies individually, and in combination, on improving CVD risk is not known. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to utilize a trans disciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of reducing CVD risk in low-resource settings. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that group medical visits integrated into micro finance groups will be effective and cost-effective in reducing CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and at increased risk for diabetes in western Kenya. We further hypothesize that changes in social network characteristics may mediate the impact of these interventions, and that baseline social network characteristics may moderate the impact. Aim 1 is to identify contextual factors, facilitators, and barriers that may impact integration of group medical visits and micro finance groups in this setting, using novel qualitative research techniques. We will then design a contextually and culturally appropriate integrated group medical visit microfinance model for CVD risk reduction. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of group medical visits and micro finance groups for CVD risk reduction among individuals with diabetes or at increased risk of diabetes, by conducting a four-arm cluster randomized trial comparing: 1) usual clinical care; 2) usual clinical care plus micro finance groups only; 3) group medical visits only; and 4) group medical visits integrated into micro finance groups. The primary outcome will be one-year change in systolic BP, and a key secondary outcome will be change in QRISK2 CVD risk score. We will also conduct mediation analysis and moderation analysis to evaluate the influence of social network characteristics on intervention outcomes. Aim 3 is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of each intervention arm of the trial. The research will be accomplished by an Early Stage Principal Investigator with extensive experience in implementation research in low-resource settings, supported by a trans disciplinary team of investigators with diverse and complementary expertise. Our goal is to add to the existing knowledge base of innovative, scale-able, and sustainable strategies to reduce CVD risk in diabetes and other chronic diseases in low-resource settings worldwide.The results of this work will add to the emerging body of knowledge on innovative, scalable, and sustainable strategies for effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetes and other chronic diseases among vulnerable populations in low-resource settings worldwide.

135	Energy Optimization and Field Demonstration of the Anaerobic Digestion Pasteurization Latrine (ADPL)	Deshusses, Marc	Kenya		July 2015	Ongoing	The Anaerobic Digestion Pasteurization Latrine (ADPL) is a promising decentralized and autonomous sanitation system conceived by Dr. Deshusses which harnesses the energy in fecal waste for pathogen elimination. The ADPL converts organics in fecal waste to biogas, part of it which is then burned to pasteurize the treated waste. The ADPL offers a potentially viable alternative to basic pit latrines. The system is self-contained, requires no energy input, destroys all pathogens and provides a safe effluent with fertilizer value. Before ADPLs can be deployed on a large scale, optimization and field testing are required. In particular, net biogas utilization could be reduced by incorporating passive solar heating during day time. This would increase the surplus biogas and make it available for other uses such as cooking. Thus, the objective of this collaborative project is to optimize energy generation and utilization in the ADPL by incorporating passive solar for heat sterilization and using inexpensive microcontrollers. These improvements will be implemented in three ADPLs in Eldoret, Kenya and field monitoring of energy generation and treatment efficacy will be conducted. This research is at the intersection of energy and global health. The team includes two Duke professors who have not collaborated before, a research group at the University of Eldoret, and a local entrepreneur interested in global health. This project will also strengthen the existing collaboration with the University of Eldoret and provide much needed financial support there. Sources of follow-on funding have been identified.

136	Development of Composite Ceramic - Silver and Red Mud Water Filters to Control Biological and Arsenic Contamination in Drinking Water	Deshusses, Marc	India		July 2015	Ongoing	Low cost technologies to monitor, treat, and/or prevent water contamination are critical means to improve the health of billions of people in less developed countries. On the Indian continent, contamination of drinking water with pathogens of fecal origin and with arsenic is a serious health concern. In this collaborative project, we propose to develop composite ceramic/red mud/silver-based water filtration systems for the removal of arsenic and microorganisms in drinking water. At first, we aim to conduct a meta analysis of the red mud and ceramic filters to fully document the potential scope, opportunities and limits of such filters as well as establishing a track record of our collaboration. Secondly, we will fabricate new composite ceramic/red mud/colloidal silver water filters. The properties of the composites will be characterized thoroughly and the performance of the filters will be investigated to determine the effects of the inherent red mud composition, silver and manufacturing process parameters on the properties of the filters, namely water flow, efficacy of disinfection of key indicator pathogen organisms, and removal of arsenic. Finally, a detailed cost analysis for mass producing filtration units will be performed, possible field trials will be explored with a key partner and external grants to support follow-on studies will be pursued. An additional objective of the proposal will be to bring together two research groups who have not worked together before, and build on this collaborative research to enhance connections between Engineering and Global Health at Duke University and the Natural Sciences at Shiv Nadar University.

138	A Viable Solution for a See-and-Treat Paradigm for Cervical Pre-cancer in Africa	Ramanujam, Nimmi	Tanzania		July 2015	Ongoing	"There is a critical global need for a See and Treat paradigm for cervical cancer that is effective in low-and middle-income communities (LMIC). Guidelines have been written by the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) on strategies for screening cervical cancer in resource-limited settings. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or VIA with low power magnification (VIAM) combined with cryotherapy or Loop Electrosurgical Procedure (LEEP) appears to be the most viable option for reducing the mortality associated with cervical cancer in the low and middle income countries (LMICs). The colposcope, a low magnification microscope has been historically used for (VIAM) in women with an abnormal Pap smear. Sites that display acetowhitening are biopsied and evaluated by a pathologist. The cervix is treated with LEEP if pre-cancerous lesions are found. In LMICs, this approach is not practical due to the lack of infrastructure and resources and also due to patient attrition at each level of care. Thus it is critical to develop point of care technologies that enable a see and treat paradigm in a single visit within the local communities where the women live. Our long-term goal is to leverage community-clinics as a way to bring early detection and treatment of cervical pre-cancer to as many patients as possible in LMICs particularly in places where hospitals are not easily accessible. We propose to implement a portable, point of care technology that consolidates the colposcope into a hand-held device and with an integrated visible light diffuse reflectance optical spectroscope that rapidly measures oxygen saturation, neovascularization and the morphological composition of acetowhitened sites identified by VIAM that are known to be altered with neoplastic progressions. The colpospectroscope will enable surveillance with VIAM followed by spectroscopy (in lieu histopathology on a biopsy specimen) such that cervical dysplasia can be diagnosed on the spot thereby enabling a ""see and treat"" paradigm for women with cervical pre-cancer with cryotherapy and/or LEEP in at the same visit."

139	Exploring risk for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in South Africa	Watt, Melissa	South Africa		June 2015	June 2015	PI: Melissa WattCo-PI: Soraya Seedat (Stellenbosch University)Investigator: Kathleen SikkemaFunder: DGHI Pilot Grant, 2015-2016Site: Cape Town, South AfricaAlcohol use during pregnancy is recognized for its deleterious impacts on fetal development and neonatal outcomes, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The Western Cape Province of South Africa, historically a wine-growing region, has among the highest rates of FASD globally. Reducing the incidence of FASD in the Western Cape requires novel prevention interventions that target individuals at high risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Our research in Cape Town suggests that targeting women who drink in alcohol-serving venues can be a feasible and effective strategy for FASD prevention. One strategy for primary prevention of FASD is the prevention of unintended pregnancies among women who drink at hazardous levels. Among a cohort of 560 women whom we recruited from alcohol-serving venues and followed over 12 months, 20% became pregnant; almost all pregnancies were unintended, and in almost all cases women continued to drink heavily during pregnancy. Developing interventions to reduce unintended pregnancy among women who drink requires a nuanced understanding of their attitudes, social norms, and beliefs that influence contraceptive use, as well as an understanding of the structural and contextual barriers and facilitators that impact their ability to access and use contraceptives effectively. The objective of this DGHI small grant is to understand pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use patterns among women who drink in alcohol-serving venues.This mixed-methods study builds on our history of community-engaged research in South Africa to address the following aims:Aim #1: To quantitatively document factors influencing pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use among women who attend alcohol-serving venues, by conducting cross-sectional surveys of 120 women recruited from four alcohol-serving venues.Aim #2: To qualitatively explore the social norms, barriers, and facilitators that influence consistent and effective use of contraceptives among women who engage in hazardous drinking, by conducting in-depth interviews with 24 women purposively recruited from the survey respondents.Aim #3: To assess available contraceptive options and to identify structural factors that support or obstruct access to contraception, by conducting a structured situational analysis of reproductive health services available in the community.The study is complete, and findings are reported in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. Among 200 women surveyed, almost all met criteria for hazardous drinking. In total, 20.3% of sexually active women were identified as at-risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy, and two women were currently pregnant and drinking. Given the high rates of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, alcohol-serving venues should be targeted for FASD prevention interventions. Efforts should be made to increase uptake of long-acting contraceptives among women who do not wish to get pregnant, and to promote alcohol cessation among women with pregnancy intentions.

141	Iodine Deficiency and Gender Attitudes in Tanzania		Tanzania		January 2015	Ongoing	Despite progress in recent years, girls and women remain disadvantaged relative to boys in many parts of the world, with multiple negative potential implications. At the heart of gender inequality are social norms and attitudes about gender that give rise to and perpetuate discriminatory institutions, and ultimately inhibit institutional and behavioral change. Despite this, little is understood about the how gender norms and attitudes evolve and adapt. One important question is why is gender inequality acute and persistent in particular societies but not others? A related question is how readily do gender attitudes evolve when women are given more opportunities to advance and thereby influence perceptions about women's relative ability? This project will contribute to our understanding of both questions by collecting new and unique data that will be used to investigate how gender attitudes respond to improvements in girls' schooling and a narrowing of the gender gap in cognitive ability that arose from reductions in fetal iodine deficiency in Tanzania. In particular, data from a previous evaluation of the Tanzania maternal iodine supplementation program showed that girls born during the program had achieved nearly a year of additional schooling attainment by ages 12-15, whereas boys benefited very little, consistent with scientific evidence that iodine deficiency is more acute for females at early stages of brain development. The study will track 1200 households from 16 districts of Tanzania that benefited from the program and collect data on gender attitudes of parents of children born during the program using Implicit Association Tests (IATs), and data on economic outcomes of their children. The study aims to: (1) Develop culturally appropriate IATs to measure gender attitudes and stereotyping, and dewvelop and test survey questions to measure explicit beliefs about male and female relative ability and gender stereotyping; (2) Assess the causal effect of reductions in fetal iodine deficiency among girls on parental gender attitudes by making use of quasi-experimental variation in program exposure that has been established in previous research in conjunction with the data we collect from parents on gender attitudes and preferences; and (3) Assess the feasibility of conducting a survey of children who benefited from in utero supplementation by collecting location information and gathering proxy data on kids' long-run outcomes. The proposed study will be the first to use rigorous, recently developed approaches to assess the causal association between girls' susceptibility to fetal iodine deficiency and parental gender attitudes.

142	Integration of mHealth with Scalable Screening Tool for Cervical Cancer in LMICs	Ramanujam, Nimmi	Tanzania,Kenya		January 2015	Completed	Cervical cancer affects the lives of 500,000 women worldwide each year, and results in more than 270,000 deaths. More than 75% of cervical cancer incidence is in Africa, and the highest incidence is in East Africa. Screening for cervical cancer in East Africa is performed using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Women who are identified as VIA positive are treated with cryotherapy. There are significant issues with the implementation of VIA in low resource countries. Colposcopy, which is the technology used for VIA in the U.S. is not available for use in limited resource settings. Thus, VIA is performed with a light source and the naked eye. Even with appropriate training, however, there can be large variations in accuracy due to the highly subjective nature of the test and variation in health worker experience. Furthermore, in Tanzania, where the incidence of cervical cancer is highest, the health-worker-to-population ratio is one of the lowest globally (1:45,000), and this dearth of trained screeners is a significant bottleneck. The overall consequence is that only 6,000 of the eligible 4 million women in Tanzania are screened for cervical cancer annually. Our vision is to develop and implement a technological strategy that will improve task shifting (from operator to technology) and is grounded in stakeholders’ needs and experiences surrounding cervical cancer screening to improve scalability of cervical cancer screening in limited resource settings. We have developed a novel technology called a trans-vaginal digital colposcope (TVDC) that has the form factor of a tampon and is significantly less expensive (several hundreds of dollars), than a state-of-the-art digital colposcope (tens of thousands of dollars). We have evaluated the TVDC on more than 40 patients and demonstrated that it has equivalent image quality to a state- of-the-art digital colposcope. Highly sensitive testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is on the horizon and has the potential to be used for primary screening technique, but lacks sufficient specificity for CIN-2 detection; thus a secondary test is recommended to confirm an HPV-positive result. State-of-the-art conventional colposcopy has higher specificity for CIN-2 detection and can be used as a confirmatory test for women with positive screening results. However, it represents a bottleneck in screening programs given the general lack of highly trained colposcopists and its relative high cost. The development of simple, affordable, and scalable diagnostic methods with a higher specificity for CIN-2 detection are urgently needed to triage women with HPV-positive or VIA-positive results to reduce overtreatment among women in resource-limited settings. Dr. Ramanujam and her team have developed an innovative technology: a transvaginal digital colposcope (TVDC) that has the form factor of a tampon, and the performance of a state-of-the-art digital colposcope. It is significantly less expensive than a conventional colposcope but has comparable image quality because it is placed inside the vagina like a trans-vaginal ultrasound probe at a much closer working distance than a traditional colposcope. Specifically, the goal of this project will be to develop and deliver the technology and to conduct clinical validation of the system.

143	China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study		China	https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/sites/default/files/u587/CLHLS.pdf	January 2015	Ongoing	To shed new light on a better understanding of the determinants of healthy longevity of human beings. Until present, the CLHLS conducted face-to-face interviews with 10-20,000 individuals aged 65 years or older in 1998, 2000, 20002, 2005, 2008-09, 2010-11, and 2013-14 respectively, using internationally compatible questionnaires. The objectives of CLHLS includes: 1. Collect intensive individual interview data including health, disability, demographic, family, socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors for mortality and healthy longevity. 2. Follow up the oldest-old and the comparison group of the younger elders, as well as some of the elders' adult children to ascertain changes in their health status, care needs and costs, and associated factors. We will also ascertain mortality and causes of death, as well as care needs, costs, and health/disability status before death. 3. Analyze the collected data to estimate the impacts of social, behavioral, environmental, and biological risk factors that are determinants of healthy longevity and mortality in the oldest-old. 4. Compare the findings with results from other studies of large populations at advanced age. Our specific objective is to understand how psychological, physiological, environmental and lifestyle indicators explain the survival among Chinese older adults.We are drafting several manuscripts investigating the associations between lifestyle indicators and survival among Chinese older adults as well as gene-environmental interactions in determining cardiovascular health.Six major policy reports based on census and CLHLS data submitted to the Chinese central government were reviewed by and received written comments from the President, Prime Minister and 3 Vice Prime Ministers, respectively, in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2015. Other >20 policy reports based on CLHLS was submitted to various governmental agencies.

145	Frugal Innovations: Global Case Studies	Udayakumar, Krishna	United States		January 2015	Completed	As health systems in high-income countries struggle to balance affordability, quality, and access to care, particularly for their most vulnerable populations, health innovations arising in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) represent a source of ideas for new models of care and technologies to help address these challenges. Studying frugal health innovations globally through a systematic approach provides an opportunity to learn from the work of entrepreneurs employing novel methods and models of care in low- and middle-income countries and provides an avenue to identify promising new solutions for the US and elsewhere. Funding from the Commonwealth Fund will support IPIHD to identify, prioritize, and further analyze three models from its global network of health innovations that have the potential to address critical challenges facing the US healthcare system. Selected models would likely target high-need, high-cost patients and conditions as well as low-income patients and other vulnerable populations lacking affordable access to high quality care. Over the course of this 10-month project, IPIHD will work with the Commonwealth Fund to select three promising models and will develop in-depth case studies detailing various aspects of the operational processes, revenue structures, and patient populations supported by these models, as well as considerations related to how they might be adapted to the US context. These case studies will provide the Commonwealth Fund with greater understanding of the potential of these frugal innovations to be replicated in the US and will serve as a foundation for designing and implementing a US-based frugal innovation pilot.

146	Bihar Evaluation of Social Franchasing and Telemedicine (BEST) Supplement	Mohanan, Manoj	United States,India,United Kingdom		January 2015	Ongoing	"COHESIVE-India, a collaboration of researchers from Duke, Stanford, University College London, and World Bank, along with partners from ISERDD, Sambodhi, and PHFI, was awarded ""BEST-- Bihar Evaluation of Social Franchising and Telemedicine"" in June 2011. The purpose of this proposal is to add additional funding to the existing project to enable the primary investigators to devote more effort to the project and accommodate an extended timeline. The goal of the project remains to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the Gates private provider project which is a social franchising and telemedicine project being implemented by World Health Partners (WHP). This Evaluation Project will be conducted by COHESIVE-India and its partners in consultation with the Gates Foundation. Given the complexity and time-sensitive nature of the proposed study, the evaluation project will be undertaken in two parts, which are planned to follow seamlessly from one to the other. The first part was the preparatory phase of the evaluation which began in November 2010 and ended in May 2011 and the second is implementation of the field work which began in June 2011. This proposal focuses on additional funding for the implementation phase of the evaluation. The implementation phase (June 2011 - December 2015) of the evaluation project focuses on the field work, including surveys, data analysis, and preparation of manuscripts. We will begin the second round of data collection in May 2014. The first activity will be to undertake a house listing, from which a cluster randomized sample of households will be selected for the full household survey. Provider assessments will be conducted which includes patient observation, vignettes and standardized patients. Questions will be included in the household and provider surveys to collect data to conduct a cost effectiveness analysis."

147	Identifying opportunities to promote engagement in HIV care following childbirth in South Africa	Watt, Melissa	South Africa		December 2014	Ongoing	PI: Melissa WattCo-PI: John Joska (University of Cape Town)Investigator: Kathleen SikkemaFunder: Duke Center for AIDS Research, 2015-2016Site: Cape Town, South AfricaNearly one in three pregnant women in South Africa is living with HIV. Under the new Option B+ protocol for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), all pregnant women initiate lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Engagement of women in HIV care following childbirth has proven to be problematic, and may compromise the success of the Option B+ protocol. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct qualitative research to understand the complex array of factors that support or obstruct women's engagement with HIV care in the postpartum period, in order to identify specific intervention targets. The hypothesis is that mental health and social relationships play important roles in shaping long-term care engagement. The study team will first review existing clinic protocols and policies affecting referrals and integration of care across relevant services (antenatal care, birthing and delivery, infant care, and HIV clinics) and conduct 5-10 key informant interviews with providers and administrators at these sites. Second, the study team will conduct repeated in-depth interviews with 20 women who initiated ART during pregnancy. Interviews will be conducted during the last trimester of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum in order to understand the factors that influence how women negotiate engagement in HIV care in the postpartum period. In order to provide broader perspectives on care engagement, women will also be asked to refer a support person for an interview. The qualitative data will be analyzed in an iterative fashion, using a content analytic approach that involves analytic memos, data display matrices, thematic coding, and triangulation across data sources. At the completion of this study, the study will have produced data to inform the development and pilot test of an intervention to support women's continuous engagement in HIV care following childbirth.Data collection concluded in 2017, with analysis of interviews underway.

148	Epic Allies: A Gaming Mobile Phone Application to Improve Engagement in Care, Antiretroviral Uptake and Adherence among Young Men Who Have Sex with Men	LeGrand, Sara	United States		December 2014	Ongoing	Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds of all new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing an increase in HIV incidence. After diagnosis, many YMSM do not enter medical care, get prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART), adhere to ART regimens or achieve viral suppression. Novel theory-based interventions that optimize engagement in care, ART uptake and ART adherence for HIV YMSM are urgently needed to achieve both individual and public health benefits. Our study will evaluate the efficacy Epic Allies, a theory-based mobile phone application (app) that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve engagement in care, ART uptake, ART adherence and viral suppression rates among HIV YMSM. Social networking technologies enhance support and reduce social isolation, while game mechanics engage users to motivate and sustain behavior change. High mobile phone ownership among YMSM supports using intervention tools based in these familiar, available technologies. The app addresses the most common engagement and adherence barriers among youth is tailored for the target population and is customizable for individual users. Epic Allies targets HIV YMSM aged 16-24, who are new to care (naïve) or non-adherent to ART. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, through a Phase I SBIR application we worked with programmers and designers at Caktus Consulting Group to develop and test the Epic Allies prototype and found it acceptable among a sample of HIV YMSM. Our current Phase II proposal has 3 aims: Aim 1: Refine Epic Allies for use in a clinic-based trial and expand the scope of the developed app to address engagement in care and ART uptake. Enhancements to the social networking features of the app will be made to ensure the communication and support needs of youth who are not currently on ART and those new to care are met. To inform these changes, we will conduct in-depth usability interviews with 8-10 YMSM not currently on ART and new to care. Aim 2: Test Epic Allies app among 200 HIV YMSM recruited from 4 Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) sites and a North Carolina site. We will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with measures at baseline 3, 6 and 9 months. Primary outcome measures will include engagement in care, ART uptake, medication adherence and viral load suppression. Aim 3: Conduct a process evaluation of Epic Allies including intervention acceptability, impact and long-term sustainability. Qualitative in-depth exit interviews (n=30) will evaluate Epic Allies' acceptability with the target population and its potential to improve engagement in care, uptake of ART and adherence.This project will have high public health impact as it will address the current gap in scientific knowledge regarding how to best assist YMSM who are newly diagnosed with HIV and those who have adherence difficulties in order to improve medical, psychological, and public health outcomes. Moreover, the creation of a novel technology based adherence tool could be easily adapted for other highly prevalent and costly chronic diseases.

149	Encouraging Healthy Nutrition Purchases in an Online Grocery Setting using Experimental Economics	Finkelstein, Eric	Singapore		December 2014	Ongoing	Low quality diets and their relationship to obesity and poor health outcomes are of increasing concern in Singapore, and local policy-makers are looking to identify strategies aimed at encouraging healthier food consumption in efforts to combat obesity and improve public health. This proposal aims to support these efforts by designing a study to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions aimed to encourage higher quality diets, with the broader goal of informing policy on reducing rates of obesity and enhancing the public health profile of Singapore. To this end, this study proposes to develop an online grocery store and enroll participants to make their typical grocery purchases through this store. Using the information gathered from the participants’ purchasing behavior, this proposal will apply experimental economic methods to test the extent to which food purchasing behavior can be positively influenced through a series of nutrition information and/or incentive-based interventions. The findings from this research can be used by policymakers in efforts to improve the value of nutrition information to discourage unhealthy food consumption, and by insurers and others looking to design value-based programs that reward participant’s for healthier food purchases.

150	Impact of Spatial distribution of health services on child morbidity and mortality	Prudhomme O'Meara, Wendy			December 2014	Ongoing	"Globally, fifty percent of deaths in children occur in sub-Saharan Africa. If the current trend persists, Sub-Saharan Africa will not reach Millennium Development Goal 4 (reduce child mortality by two thirds) until 2165, 150 years after the target date. Treatable or preventable infectious diseases such as pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea, account for 61% of childhood deaths after the neonatal period. Therefore, a large proportion of deaths from birth to the fifth birthday are attributable to a handful of common causes that are avoidable through existing interventions, many of which are delivered through health facilities. It seems probable that access to these life-saving interventions is limited by the health systems that deliver them. The objective of the proposed work is to use innovative spatial techniques to quantify the contribution of access to health services in reducing childhood morbidity and mortality. We will use large, existing datasets to describe the relationship between health outcomes and geographic distribution of health services at different spatial scales. Ultimately, the goal of such an approach is to provide evidence regarding the impact of health systems infrastructure on disease burden, independent of disease-specific interventions. The impact of health systems is difficult to measure and large comparison studies or randomized trials are often not feasible. However, applying spatial statistical techniques to this problem can provide evidence for causal relationships in the absence of a counterfactual.W. P. O'Meara, A. Platt, V. Naanyu, D. Cole, S.

However, their impact on population health is difficult to measure. Our analysis of large-scale survey data reveals important associations between health systems characteristics and child survival in Kenya, independent of utilization or specific interventions, and lends weight to the argument that user fees for child services are detrimental to child survival. Furthermore, the presence of highly trained staff do not appear to be the limiting factor in Kenya. Instead, more attention should be given to understanding the role of the private sector and investment in improving the distribution of health services infrastructure."

151	Assessing Odor Issues and Control Strategies for the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge (RTTC)	Deshusses, Marc			November 2014	Ongoing	The objective of this project is to conduct a broad survey to define the landscape of odor nuisance and control in fecal sludge management (FSM) and to determine the applicability of traditional and emerging filtration options to control odor using biochars both as an adsorbent and as a support material for bacteria in biofilters. The targeted applications are those odors emitted from the Gates Foundation Reinvent the Toilet (RTT) systems and emerging FSM methods, i.e., primarily fecal odors, but also including combustion or drying of fecal sludge.A broad survey (>200 respondents) on the effects of odor on toilet choice and sanitation was administered. Olfactometry and synthetic fecal sludge odor mixes were developed in the laboratory. Efficient odor control modules relying on adsorption to biochars and on biological filtration have been developed and are being tested.

152	An Early Warning System for Vector-borne Disease Risk in the Amazon	Pan, William	United States,Peru		November 2014	Ongoing	The Amazon basin is a region with significant vector borne disease burden. Malaria, leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, and others continue to disproportionately threaten the most remote and impoverished Amazonian communities where local response capabilities are limited and largely dependent on regional / national resources. The dynamics of these diseases are, in part, a function of physical environment; thus, hydrometeorology, landscape morphology, and land cover all contribute to whether vector species involved in disease transmission can thrive. Human infection risk is further modulated by settlement and activity patterns. Risk monitoring and early warning systems (EWS) are most effective when they consider both human and environmental processes. Under Feasibility Study funding from the NASA Applied Sciences Health and Air Quality Program (2011-2013), proposal team members developed a pilot malaria EWS for the northern Peruvian Amazon. We found malaria risk can be predicted using statistical methods that combine data from an advanced NASA land data assimilation system, satellite-derived land cover, and regional human population and malaria surveillance. Building on our pilot, we propose to: (1) operationalize our EWS to a larger geographic area, namely across the Ecuadorian border and the Southern Peruvian Amazon, employing finer-scale risk estimates; and (2) expand and evaluate system performance in predicting spatio-temporal variation of additional vector-borne disease endpoints, focusing initially on leishmania We will achieve these two goals by leveraging existing partnerships with the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 and the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Ministries of Health. The proposed system-146's innovation is that it will leverage data from new NASA missions (GPM, SMAP, VIIRS, Landsat8) and improved human settlement data to improve model prediction from the pilot study. Our spatio-temporal risk maps will bolster the abilities of our end users to prevent vector-borne disease outbreaks in the face of changing environmental and climatic conditions.

154	Developing a Measure of Caregiver Readiness to Disclose HIV Serostatus	Green, Eric	Zimbabwe,United States		October 2014	Ongoing	An estimated 2.5 million children younger than 15 years are living with HIV, and most do not know it. Estimates of pediatric HIV disclosure rates in low-resource settings range from 14-46%, indicating a sizable number of children living with IV--predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa-- who are unaware of their HIV status. These children may begin antiretroviral therapy without learning the nature of their illness, or the purpose of the medication. Children who are not told that they have a serious health condition exhibit lower adherence to treatment and poorer health outcomes than those aware of their status. Children who know their status exhibit higher self-esteem, fewer behavior problems, and less psychological distress. After disclosure, they may also have improved social functioning, more social support, more positive health attitudes, better health outcomes, and more hope for the future. International guidance recommends that HIV-positive children of school-age should be informed of their serostatus; but disclosure is a complex and difficult process for caregivers, who may fear that their child is too young, that disclosing may cause psychological harm, or that child and family will be exposed to stigma. Healthcare providers need training and tools to provide genuinely relevant and meaningful support at this difficult time. A growing body of evidence supports interventions helping caregivers in low-resource settings to disclose serostatus (their own and the child's) to the child, supported by various resources, such as REPSSI's Talking Book. A remaining challenge, however, is that providers still need to tailor their use of these interventions to how ready a caregiver is to disclose, including their perception of child readiness. We believe that a missing and needed resource is a valid and easy to use tool to help lay and professional counselors to assess caregiver readiness and self-efficacy to disclose, in order to tailor disclosure support interventions. Our long-term goal is therefore to provide counselors with an accessible tool to monitor caregiver readiness and self-efficacy to disclose serostatus (caregiver's and/or child's) to school-age children in order to promote the tailoring of existing disclosure support interventions, thereby facilitating a healthy disclosure process. Our specific objective is to develop the assessment tool and test its reliability and validity in a low-resource setting. Our central hypothesis is that disclosure is a process and that caregiver readiness and self-efficacy can be measured in a valid and reliable way. The instrument will be based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change, which posits that readiness to engage in a behavior can be categorized into stages to inform therapeutic interventions. Our specific aims are to: 1. Investigate the process of HIV disclosure and the barriers and facilitators of caregivers' readiness to disclose through qualitative inquiry with adult caregivers of HIV-positive children, adults and adolescents living with HIV, and primary care clinic staff; 2. Develop an instrument to assess caregiver readiness and self-efficacy to disclose that can be used by primary care health workers to inform their use of HIV disclosure interventions.

156	Supplement to Healthy Eating Research to Support Commissioned Research on In-Store Marketing and Early Care and Education	Story, Mary	United States		October 2014	Ongoing	Childhood obesity is one of the most serious threats to the health of our nation. The Healthy Eating Research (HER) program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), directed by Principal Investigator Mary Story, PhD, RD, supports research to identify and evaluate policies and environmental approaches at the organizational, community, state, and national levels that have the greatest potential to improve childrens diets and energy balance to reverse the nation¿s levels of childhood obesity. Commissioned research is a key element of the HER program. Strategic, timely commissioned research will supply evidence needed by advocates, policy-makers, and others to inform and guide policy action. The HER program advances the RWJF Childhood Obesity team¿s strategy of funding policy and environmental strategies with the potential to help all children in the U.S. achieve a healthy weight. With this grant, we will fund commissioned research on in-store marketing (ISM) and early care and education (ECE). The ISM focus area touches on three of RWJFs four food-related policy priorities: 1. increasing access to high-quality, affordable foods through new or improved grocery stores and healthier corner stores and bodegas; 2. using pricing incentives and disincentives to promote the purchase of healthier foods; and 3. reducing youths exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods through regulation, policy and effective industry self-regulation. ECE, an important setting for young children, holds great potential and is a recently added area of emphasis for RWJF. With this grant, HER will develop multiple contracts for commissioned research including analyses, studies, papers, research reviews, issue briefs, and fact sheets. Key partners and consultants will be engaged to complete this work. This 24-month, $1.175 million grant is proposed to begin on 10-1-14.

158	Reducing Barriers to Mental Health Task Sharing: Stigma Reduction in Primary Care	Kohrt, Brandon	Nepal		September 2014	Ongoing	The global burden of disease attributable to depression rose 37% from 1990 to 2010. The future projected rise is greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there is a gap of 1.2 million health workers needed to provide mental health services in LMIC. Task-sharing, the involvement of non-specialist health workers to deliver mental health services, is an essential aspect of reducing this gap. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of task-sharing interventions including psychotherapy have demonstrated depression symptom reduction in numerous LMIC. Barriers to scaling up RCTs include negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among non-specialist health workers against persons with mental illness. The goal of this K01 Mentored Research Career Development Award is to broaden the candidate's expertise in complex intervention trials of task-sharing initiatives with a focus on reducing negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among health workers assuming new responsibilities in mental health care delivery. Through research, coursework, and structured mentorship activities, the candidate will develop new competencies in complex intervention research including 1. conceptual knowledge of complex interventions and theory of change; 2. methodological techniques for design, implementation and analysis of cluster-RCTs in health systems; 3. ethical conduct of health systems intervention research in LMIC and collaboration with mental healthcare consumers; and 4. professional development to become an independent NIMH-funded investigator. Drs. Kathleen Sikkema, Vikram Patel, Crick Lund, and Bernice Pescosolido will mentor the candidate in these four objectives. The research will be conducted in Nepal through infrastructure of the NIMH U19 South Asia Hub for Advocacy, Research, and Education for Mental Health (SHARE) and the task-sharing initiative Programme for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME). The candidate will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a supplemental training module to improve attitudes toward and social engagement with persons with mental illness, with the goal of moving past traditional concepts of stigma and stigma-reduction interventions. This module will be added to a mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training to of improve provider competence in evidence based practices (EBP), and reduce patient depression severity. A pilot cluster-RCT of social engagement training for primary care workers will be conducted to assess feasibility and acceptability of content, procedures, adverse event monitoring, and analytic approaches. The aims of this pilot cluster-RCT include adaptation and pre-piloting a social engagement training module, piloting a cluster-RCT, and performing quantitative descriptive analysis to prepare for an appropriately powered R01, which would evaluate the impact of reducing negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors among primary care workers on EBP quality and patient outcomes.

163	The Adherence and Knowledge Exchange Heart Disease Medicines study		China	https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/sites/default/files/u587/Takemeds.pdf	July 2014	Ongoing	"**Background:** Achieving the WHO goal of 25% reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2025 requires aggressive prevention measures for coronary heart disease (CHD). Some studies suggest the potential impact of using mobile technology to promote secondary intervention of CHD; yet few mobile Health studies have targeted both health care providers and patient. **Research Question:** Among patients with CHD, does a multifaceted, information technology-enabled intervention directed at both the patient and health care provider increase the medication adherence for secondary prevention? **Intervention:** The intervention comprises of (1) an easy to use mobile app-based provider-level decision support system to increase the evidence-based medication prescription; (2) automated, evidence-based text messages or voice calls delivered for 12 weeks. **Aims:** 1. Develop a provider-facing mobile application that facilitates prescription of evidence-based medications for patients with established CHD; 2. Develop and contextualize patient-directed text messages/voice calls related to medication adherence for CHD and lifestyle modification; 3. Test the usability of the provider- and patient-facing interventions for increasing adherence to secondary prevention medications for CHD.The project has completed 12-weeks intervention among 190 recruited coronary heart disease patients in Shanghai and Hainan, China. After the intervention, we observed a significant improvement in medication adherence, decrease of smoking and increase of daily vegetable consumption frequency and community healthcare center visit frequency. The results is not consistent in Shanghai and Hainan due to personal and system reasons, which may affect patients' medication adherence and lifestyles. The result paper has been submitted to review and the technical development paper entitled as ""Development of a mobile phone-based intervention to improve adherence to secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in China"" has been published in Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology. A systematic review paper entitled ""Effect of Mobile Health Interventions on the Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: systematic review and meta-analysis"" has been published on Canadian Journal of Cardiology.When pilot tested, shown effective and scaled up, the project has the potential to promote the medication adherence and lifestyle modification among patients for secondary prevention, and thereby to improve patient health."

164	Bass Connections Global Health: Integrative Global Health Research on Sickle Cell Disease	Stewart, Kearsley	United States,Jamaica,Cameroon,South Africa	https://globalhealth.duke.edu/projects/integrative-global-research-sickle-cell-disease	July 2014	Ongoing	This project will engage an international team of faculty and students from a variety of levels and disciplines in collaborative research and education to develop an ecological framework for understanding and addressing Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). SCD is the first disease whose genetic etiology was defined, and is the most common single gene disorder in humans. The disease affects millions of people worldwide and is a major source of increased morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. The disease is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean basin, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and South and Central America. The frequency and severity of SCD outcomes vary markedly between patients and at different ages; however, a substantial proportion of this variation remains unexplained by current predictive models based on genetic and other biological markers of risk. Although research suggests that phenotypic heterogeneity in SCD reflects complicated influences of genes, environments (broadly defined to include physical, social, behavioral, etc.), and their interactions, there is a dearth of empirical research on the role of non-biological factors in SCD outcomes. SCD, with its global distribution, distinctive social history, poorly understood pathophysiology, and well-established heterogeneity, serves as an ideal candidate for research that could inform efforts to improve health and healthcare generally, and address health disparities in the United States (US) and abroad. The proposed research is the initial phase of a long-term endeavor to: 1. Understand the separate and joint contributions of biological and non-biological factors to phenotypic variability in SCD over the life-course. 2. Improve outcomes for people worldwide with SCD. Our multidisciplinary project team will comprise faculty and students from the US (Duke), Jamaica, Cameroon, and South Africa who will focus on specific project-related tasks pertinent to their areas of expertise and interest, simultaneously integrating their parts into the whole. We will utilize, and as needed and feasible build upon, existing clinical, social, environmental, genetic, and phenotypic data from children and adults with homozygous SCD (HbSS) at the study sites. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Reconcile patient datasets from the study sites. 2. Characterize relevant contextual (i.e. historical, cultural, and structural) dimensions of the different countries/study locations. 3. Conduct a proof-of-concept (POC) study to evaluate and refine a preliminary conceptual framework. Students and faculty will work together to accomplish these aims through diverse educational activities and applied research. Students involved in this project will acquire experience and skills pertaining to the design, implementation, and communication of integrative global health research and will contribute to the following expected deliverables: 1) a new holistic model and a new set of criteria to assess the role of the possible multifactorial sources of SCD heterogeneity; 2) hypotheses, preliminary data, and manuscripts for future externally funded grants; and 3) recommendations for attending to challenges and areas of need in relation to integrative global health research and clinical practice in SCD.Our research project will serve as a vehicle for transforming educational experiences of students at Duke and our collaborating institutions. Students participating in this project will have the opportunity to: • Gain hands-on experience in working with a diverse group of faculty and students to conduct global health disparities research • Engage with and receive mentoring from faculty in African & African American studies, global health, cultural anthropology, behavioral sciences, medicine, environmental sciences, nursing, and human genetics/genomics • Acquire knowledge and skills in different types of data collection, reconciliation, analysis, and interpretation, e.g. performing geospatial mapping, conducting and analyzing qualitative interviews, applying new technologies for integrating disparate data sets, and exploring the associations among multiple variables using an array of modern exploratory data analytic techniques • Enroll in and receive course credit for a variety of selected courses directly related to the content and activities of the research project, including courses within and outside of students' major disciplines • Enhance their writing skills (e.g. through conducting literature reviews) and contribute to study-related manuscripts and reports • Improve their oral communication skills by presenting research findings to diverse audiences at local, national, and international meetings • Compete for travel slots to Jamaica or Cameroon to gain first-hand experience with our collaborating international communities and conduct small-scale fieldwork • Engage with SCD organizations at the state and community levels in North Carolina and SCD patient support groups in Cameroon and Jamaica to organize community-based forums to facilitate public discourse on, increase knowledge about, and help address local and international issues related to SCD • Learn about countries, cultures, and peoples in diverse regions of the African Diaspora • Participate in team-based learning through project meetings and seminars led by team members • Assist with technological efforts to optimize communications and data management for the project to bridge the geographic and temporal divides created by international collaborations • Participate individually or as a group in independent projects related to the grant. Students may also implement projects as part of courses they enroll in. Students will develop their projects in consultation with their mentors and/or course instructors and in line with the progression of the grant.

167	Improving the Health of South African Women with Traumatic Stress in HIV Care	Watt, Melissa	South Africa		June 2014	Ongoing	PI: Kathleen J. SikkemaCo-PI: John Joska (University of Cape Town)Investigator: Melissa WattFunder: NIMH, R34, 2014-2017Site: Cape Town, South AfricaHIV-infected women in South Africa report high rates of sexual trauma (both childhood and adulthood experiences). Women with sexual trauma histories have poorer mental health and may have unique challenges fully engaging with HIV care. In South Africa, trauma treatment has not been well-integrated into the HIV care setting. Therefore, addressing the sequelae of sexual trauma among women within the context of HIV clinical care in South Africa can potentially improve the well-being of this patient population and also increase their engagement across the continuum of HIV treatment to reduce the forward transmission of HIV.In this three-year study, we developed and pilot tested Improving AIDS Care after Trauma (ImpACT), a brief intervention based on theories of stress, coping, and evidence-based treatment for traumatic stress. ImpACT was developed using an iterative process to culturally adapt a cognitive-behavioral intervention for delivery to women newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the South African clinical setting. Feedback from key informant interviews, in-depth interviews, and a trial run helped refine session content and the adaptation of key intervention elements.ImpACT was evaluated for feasibility and potential efficacy in a public clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, with a pilot intervention trial enrolling 64 participants. In exploratory analysis of primary outcomes, ImpACT participants, compared to Standard of Care, reported greater reductions in avoidance and arousal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and greater increases in ART adherence motivation at 3 months. Clinically significant decreases in overall PTSD symptoms were also demonstrated at 3 months. These effects continued as trends at the 6-month assessment, in addition to increases in social/spiritual coping. A trauma-focused, culturally-adapted individual intervention delivered by a non-specialist in the HIV care setting is feasible and acceptable. Preliminary findings suggest ImpACT has potential to reduce PTSD symptoms and increase ART adherence motivation, but a more intensive intervention may be needed to improve and maintain care engagement among this population. Outcomes are published in AIDS and Behavior.Future research goals include evaluating the effectiveness and exploring the scalability of ImpACT+ (a six-session, individual-level coping intervention, refined based on the pilot trial of ImpACT) in a full-scale trial.

171	Impact of Perinatal Depression Treatment on Child development outcomes		United States,United Kingdom,Pakistan		May 2014	Ongoing	Maternal depression is a serious disorder that not only negatively impacts the depressed woman but also has long-lasting negative consequences on her child. Specifically, the increased risk of mental health problems in the child persists over the lifecourse and is again transmitted to the next generation. Although maternal depression treatments are available, the degree to which they causally shift the child's socio-emotional, cognitive, and physical development trajectory is less well understood. Importantly, randomized controlled trials comparing multiple depression interventions have not been well equipped to answer this important question due to insufficient follow-up periods; the interventions beginning after the most sensitive developmental periods; or lack of appropriate comparison groups. The success of a given intervention depends on multiple factors, with a key modifiable factor being the extent to which an intervention can alter the parenting behaviors of the depressed woman. Our long term objective is to identify key modifiable factors in the intergenerational transmission of risk from a depressed mother to her child. The goal of this study is to rigorously evaluate the impact of a perinatal depression intervention that starts prenatally and continues through 6 months post-partum, on child development. We will achieve this by combining, and fully integrating, with a funded perinatal depression intervention clustered RCT (SHARE: U19MH095687). In addition to enrolling the depressed women who will participate in the SHARE trial, we will also enroll a subset of non- depressed women, and follow-up the mother-child dyads for at least 36 months post-partum. Enrolling the not depressed mothers enables us to determine the extent to which the intervention can lead to equivalence between the treated depressed and non-depressed groups as well as to identify potential positive externalities to non-depressed women in the intervention arm. Together, these approaches will yield decisive evidence of the causal impact of a perinatal depression intervention on child developmental outcomes. We hypothesize that depression intervention will improve child outcomes relative to the control group, and we will examine whether it will also result in the convergence of outcomes to those children whose mothers were not depressed prenatally. We will also analyze potential mediators focusing on whether improved parenting quality is an important mechanism linking the depression intervention and child outcomes. Finally, we will determine how the relationship between participating in the intervention and child outcomes varies by factors such as family composition, socioeconomic status, and exposure to interpersonal violence. We expect the results of this research to inform the design of future perinatal depression interventions that will have the greatest protective impact on future generations.

We will leverage the center’s national network of hospitals already participating in several transformational stroke studies including the Chinese National Stroke Registry. This clinical registry includes participation of 221 hospitals across China committed to examining the provision of acute stroke care and improving stroke care quality. However, research and quality improvement efforts to date with participating hospitals have focused entirely within the hospital, do not involve nursing or rehabilitation professionals, do not address discharge planning and the transition of stroke patients back to their community-level providers, and do not provide clinical follow-up (post-discharge patient contact is for outcome assessment only). Discussions are ongoing with the Center’s leadership and this will be the first proposal for research that evaluates the landscape for multi-site research on care that extends beyond acute treatment and addresses post-stroke needs.

174	Knowledge and preferences for treatment of end stage renal disease among elderly patients and their family caregivers	Finkelstein, Eric	Singapore		February 2014	Ongoing	Understanding patient’s preferences regarding treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is important to guide treatment recommendations and policies. Currently, treatment choices for ESRD are likely to be distorted by a lack of knowledge among patients and their caregivers regarding outcomes and costs that result from a given choice. Therefore, this study proposes to assess patient and caregiver knowledge about outcomes and costs of dialysis and conservative treatment, and to quantify the extent to which select features and outcomes of dialysis influence the decision to choose it over conservative treatment, and the change in uptake that would result from a given change in one of the attribute levels (or better information on that attribute). The study involves focus groups with stated preference conjoint survey with elderly stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients.	Cancer

Knowledge. 4 Care (ASK4Care) is a peer-lead retention in care program that promotes HIV knowledge, communication skills, community building, and health prioritization among people living with HIV who are newly diagnosed, and those who are accessing care but not optimizing it. Combined with community-based HIV testing already in place at each partner site, ASK4Care will usher those who are newly diagnosed with HIV into medical care and supportive peer programs to promote lifelong adherence skills. ASK4Care is an eight module knowledge and skills-building program lead by peers who have themselves overcome personal barriers to accessing care and staying in care. ASK4Care includes six modules that help clients engaged in medical care to become more active in their own health care, two additional modules use text messaging, an effective means to reach people of lower socio-economic status in rural and suburban areas, to promote general health and support individual's health and wellness goals. The ASK4Care partners include: Hertford County Public Health Authority serving a rural 11-county area of North Carolina, Partners In Caring serving a suburban coastal six-county area, and the Lincoln Community Health Center serving the urban Durham county area.Peer-lead modules have been created to promote health literacy and engagement. No data are available yet.If shown effective, ASK4Care will provide a new tool for promoting patient engagement and retention in medical care, particularly for patients of lower socio-economic status and those in rural areas.

181	Evaluating the Impact of Mercury Contamination on Human and Environmental Health in Madre de Dios Watershed	Pan, William	Peru		September 2012	Ongoing	The Madre de Dios (MDD) and Beni Rivers together comprise a major tributary to the Amazon River, flowing from the MDD region in Peru, Peru through to Pando, Bolivia. It is home to over 150,000 Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and has one of the largest concentrations of biodiversity in the world with at least four protected parks. Leading causes of morbidity and mortality are respiratory, malaria, and gastrointestinal infections, but other common diseases include dengue, rabies, arenaviruses and hantaviruses, which have been emerging due to increased anthropogenic activities, among which, gold mining, agriculture, and road construction are the most important. In MDD alone, gold mining is incipient due to rising global demand. These artisanal mining operations are devastating to an ecosystem. Mercury is used for the amalgamation of gold, a process in which up to 60% of the mercury used gets released directly into the environment and wastes containing mercury accumulate in the alluvial sediment and biaccumulates as methyl-mercury (MeHg) in fish that are consumed by humans. Of all mercury forms, MeHg is by far the most toxic as it accumulates in the food web. MeHg production in aquatic environments is mediated by anaerobic bacteria, particularly sulfate reducing bacteria. A detailed understanding of the factors affecting mercury bioavailability to sulfate reducing bacteria and the fate and transport of the various mercury species is required to understand the broad impacts of mercury, and has not previously been done in the region. As has been demonstrated in Brazil, rural riverine communities similar to those in the MDD/Beni watersheds, face not only moderate exposure to mercury, but also exposure to other heavy metals from geogenic (naturally occurring in the soil that get released from activities such as deforestation) and anthropogenic sources (e.g., inputs from mining activities) that potentially affect their health, including Arsenic and Selenium. The goals of this study are to obtain preliminary data to: 1. measure and predict the level of mercury exposure among persons living in the MDD watershed; 2. identify the major health issues affecting persons living in the MDD watershed; and 3. better understand the diversification of livelihoods among persons living in the watershed. We hypothesize that the MDD watershed is heavily contaminated with mercury and that people living in the watershed are extremely vulnerable to increasing contamination due to their limited ability to diversify risks.We expect to produce the following outcomes: 1. Evaluation of mercury contamination in areas not involved in mining, but indirectly impacted by mining activities. 2. Development of a sediment transport model that predicts the transportation of potentially contaminated sediment throughout the watershed 3. Identification of major health problems for people living in the Madre de Dios River watershed and evaluate the extent to which mercury and mining activities are related to these health problemsIf our study reveals significant mercury contamination in regions that are not involved in gold mining and our hydrological models demonstrate that contaminants are potentially affecting indigenous and non-indigenous regions across the border to Bolivia, there are major policy implications to our research. We have already reached out to the Ministries of Environment, Health and Production in Peru, the US Embassy, USAID and the Pan American Health Organization in case our study reveals such relationships.

187	6th Annual Meeting of the Alliance for Surgery and Anesthesia Presence at Duke University	Lagoo-Deenadayalan, Sandhya	United States		July 2012	Completed	Informing the literature on the paucity of surgical and safe anesthesia has been a goal of the Alliance for Surgery and Anesthesia Presence (ASAP) since inception 7 years ago. The group of more than 200 medical students, MPH students, residents, fellows and physicians from many specialties and countries, gathered to discuss topics long-considered by the group metrics, burden, maternal mortality and anesthesia, as well as topics novel to this annual meeting include cancer, neurosurgery and perioperative mortality. The faculty included esteemed members of the Duke Community, and visiting faculty from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Washington, Indiana University, Vanderbilt University, and Wake-Forest University.Participants shared their knowledge and tried to prove that the theme of the 6th Annual ASAP meeting - Partnerships in Innovation - was critical if we wished to construct a global platform for surgical and anesthetic care. The breakout groups, now a signature component of the ASAP meeting, also revealed growth in content. Topics included integrating global health into a surgery residency, future directions in global anesthesia, capacity building, obstetric anesthesia, pain management, advocacy, accountability in global health work, and reverse innovations in global health. The group on advocacy discussed the upcoming World Health Assembly and the role of this body in the future role of safe anesthesia and surgery in LMICs. The anesthesiology working group drew record numbers of participants this year, and their discussions included the perioperative mortality rate as a rough measure of patient safety.

188	Early Infant Care and Risk of Obesity (Nurture)		United States	http://nurturestudy.org	July 2012	Ongoing	The Nurture study is an observational study that follows a southern cohort of 1000 predominately black and white mothers and their infants in Durham, NC. The goal of the study is to assess weight gain in infants over their first year of life via home visiting. We conduct frequent measurements throughout infancy to help us pinpoint when children begin to gain weight excessively and help identify risk factors such as energy intake, energy expenditure, stress, and sleep that may be associated with obesity in early life. We are measuring stress via salivary cortisol assay, energy intake through maternal questionnaire, and energy expenditure and sleep using an accelerometer. The study began in August 2012 and will continue through June 2017.

190	Perinatal Depression Treatment and Child Development		Pakistan		July 2012	Ongoing	Perinatal depression, which affects 20-30% women in low-income countries, is a known risk factor for impaired child development. The purpose of the current project is to examine whether participating in a successful perinatal depression intervention (Thinking Healthy Programme, THP) has lead to improved developmental outcomes in the offspring. The THP was delivered in Pakistan in 2006; in 2012 the children will be 5-6 years old and entering kindergarten, thus allowing for an assessment of a wide range of cognitive, socio-emotional, motor and physical developmental outcomes. The THP was a clustered randomized trial where lay Lady Health Workers (LHWs) were trained to deliver a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention to mothers with major depression. In the intervention group, the health workers' routine practice of maternal and child health education incorporated CBT techniques (active listening, collaboration with the family, guided discovery of alternative health beliefs and the assigning of homework to apply what had been learned). A total of 463 mothers received the intervention and 440 received enhanced routine care which consisted of an equal number of LHW visits. At 6 months post partum, 77% of mothers in the intervention group recovered from their depressive disorder compared to and 47% in the control group, effects which were sustained at 12 months. Parents in the intervention group reported spending more time everyday on play-related activities. The main approach of the THP follow-up study consists of re-enrolling the original THP study participants and assessing developmental outcomes in the now 5-6 year old children, together with potential mediators and moderators of any association between the intervention and the outcomes of interest. We are locating and interviewing the LHWs who participated in the original study to better understand factors influencing the sustainable implementation of the intervention in the field. We are using a multi-pronged approach to re-enroll study participants. Because the original intervention was community-based, we have detailed information on the residence location of all study participants. Importantly, the Lady Health Worker infrastructure in the study area is a significant strength. The LHWs are village-based and cover about a hundred house-holds in their village. They maintain careful records of each mother and child under their care. Our re-enrollment strategies thus include direct contact based on original study residence with inquiries of family and neighbors if the woman no longer lives there; inquiring with the original cohort and current LHWs about the location of remaining women; and checking local hospital and administrative records to confirm deaths or relocations. With these strategies, we plan to successfully re-enroll 80-90% of original THP study participants. The specific domains that are assessing include child cognitive skills, executive functioning, socio-emotional skills and social functioning, motor skills, school readiness as well as anthropometric and overall health indicators. We also propose to collect detailed data on factors that may shed light on the pathways and moderators that influence the magnitude of impact of the intervention on the child outcomes 5 years later. These include the level of environmental social and cognitive stimulation in the home, mental health of other family members including the mother, socioeconomic status, as well as community factors such as access to education. If the study demonstrates a positive impact of the intervention on the child outcomes, it will provide a major impetus to policy-makers and health-planners to address maternal depression in early child development strategies.

191	A randomized controlled trial on rehabilitation through caregiver-delivered nurse-organized service programs for disabled stroke patients in rural China		China	https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/sites/default/files/u587/RECOVER.pdf	January 2014	Ongoing	**Background:** Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and disability among adults worldwide. Rehabilitation is an effective treatment for stroke; however rehabilitation services are far from adequate in China, especially in rural China. **Aims:** To develop, implement, and evaluate an evidence-based caregiver-delivered stroke rehabilitation program designed to improve the physical functioning of disabled stroke patients in rural China.The total number of patient's recruitment from Zhangwu County Hospital and Qing Tongxia County Hospital is around 190. We launched a new site in Dianjiang County People's Hospital, Chongqing City from November 2015 following the same protocol with funding support from Amsterdam Health and Technology Institute. The patient recruitment (n=60) will start from Jan, 1st 2016 and last for 6 months.This study, if proven effective, will improve the health and functioning of stroke patients, relieve caregiver burden, and build capacity within the care-delivery system.

192	A randomized controlled trial on rehabilitation through caregiver-deliverednurse-organized service programs for disabled stroke patients in rural China (The RECOVER trial)	Bettger, Janet Prvu	China		December 2013	Ongoing	"Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and the leading cause of disability among adults worldwide. Rehabilitation is an effective treatment for stroke; however rehabilitation services are nearly non-existent in rural areas, especially in China. Here, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate an evidence-based caregiver-delivered ""Early Supported Discharge (ESD)"" stroke rehabilitation program designed to improve the physical functioning of disabled stroke patients in rural China. The study will be conducted in four phases: 1. study preparation 2. pilot study 3. study revision 4. main study The pilot study will test the feasibility of the program in one county hospital among 60 patients for 3 months. The main study will test the program in two county hospitals (one in Zhangwu County, Liaoning and one in Qingtongxia County, Ningxia) among 200 patients for one year. Eligible patients (stroke inpatients with residual disability) will be randomized to the intervention group (ESD program) or control group (usual care) within 7 days of hospital admission. Patients in the intervention group will receive stroke care from a family-nominated caregiver, who will be trained in ESD by a specially trained nurse and guided by a rehabilitation manual. In the main study, a nurse will monitor patient progress and care up to 6 times. Baseline assessments of physical functioning (Barthel Index, Functional Ambulation Category), quality of life (EQ-5D), and caregiver burden (Caregiver Burden Index) will be assessed for all patients before discharge, with follow-up assessments at 3 months in the pilot study and 3, 6, and 12 months in the main study. This study, if proven effective, will seek to improve the health and functioning of stroke patients, relieve caregiver burden, build capacity and task-shift within the care-delivery system, and potentially guide future programs and policies that can improve health outcomes and reduce inequities for stroke patients in resource-scarce settings."

193	Evaluation of Barriers to Surgical Care for Children in Guatemala	Rice, Henry	Guatemala		December 2013	Completed	"The Duke Pediatric Surgery/Urology Guatemala Project, which has been active since 2010, is a collaboration between Duke University, Guatemalan partners, and non-government organizations (NGOs). The goal of the project is to support clinical care, research, and education initiatives for pediatric surgical care in Guatemala, consistent with the principles of the Duke Global Health Institute. Our work is based at the Moore Pediatric Surgical Center in Guatemala City, and is supported by two NGOs, Mending Kids International and The Shalom Foundation. Our activities following several lines: * Service: Provide high-quality care in partnership with local health providers and health systems * Learning: Perform and teach safe surgical practice in collaboration with local providers * Education: Work with local health providers on shared educational opportunities * Development: Build partnerships with local medical school and health systems * Research: Identify specific impact areas for shared research and education collaborations * Team building: Provide Duke employees with an engagement with global health programsOver the past year, we have directed several research projects in surgery, urology, and anesthesia as well as in areas of operating room systems and patient safety. Many of our trainees participated in these research efforts. 1. This year's major area of research focused on the study of barriers to surgical care for children in Guatemala, and was directed by Dr. Ben Silverberg, a DGHI Master's student in Global Health. Dr. Silverberg's project used qualitative anthropologic research methods based on structured interviews and content analysis to identify important themes in regards to barriers to care. His findings included that overwhelming financial challenges for families, a limited understanding of medical options, and poor communication between health care staff and families were most important for these families. We also extended our quantitative assessment of surgical barriers by surveying families for self-reported barriers to surgery. We used a ranking method to measure which barriers were considered most important to families. We found that there was a large delay in seeking surgical care, with a mean duration of symptoms of 2 years before accessing care. Most families lived > 50 km from the clinic. Of the barriers to surgery, costs and quality of care at available hospitals were the most frequently cited, suggesting that targeted interventions towards these barriers may be of value. 2. We performed a number of affiliated projects in anesthesiology overseen by Dr. Brad Taicher, Department of Anesthesia, Duke University. These studies assessed the effectiveness of regional anesthetics in an environment where opioid analgesics are not easily accessible. We performed regional anesthetics on 43 patients (21 caudal epidural blocks, 17 ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric blocks, 4 TAP blocks and 1 scalp block). The patients' ages ranged from 5 months to 17 years old. The caudal epidurals had a 95% success rate as assessed by a lack of response to incision and need for supplemental intra-operative analgesia. The ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric, TAP, and scalp blocks had a 100% success rate as assessed by visualization of local anesthetic deposition via ultrasound, and by confirmation from the patients of post-operative loss of temperature sensation in the ipsilateral region. None of these patients required narcotics during their overnight stay, and no complications were identified. Although limited in size, our data suggests that regional anesthetics can be a beneficial adjunct for pediatric surgery in this environment. 3. We assessed the quality and accuracy of patient checklist in this setting by measuring the accuracy of all steps of a Duke ""blue hat"" procedure. This procedure is used in the preoperative holding area to confirm proper patient identification, type and side of procedure, and essential medical information. We were able to identify vulnerable parts of the system in place at the Moore Center and prevent any incorrect procedures. 4. We assessed the differences between subjective and objective pain scoring systems in the PACU to determine whether cultural stoicism can impact administration of pain medicines. We are comparing this data to baseline data at Duke Children's Hospital and the data collection there is still under way. 5. We trained 7 perioperative nurses and technicians with no prior experience in endotracheal intubation with a novel technique to intubate children without understanding the anatomy of the airway (6/7 were successful on their first attempt). We intend to expand use of this technique to help cross-train personnel in resource constrained environments to be able to assist their anesthesia team."

196	Toward a Viable Solution for a See-and-Treat Paradigm for Cervical Pre-cancer in East Africa Using an Automated Colposcpectroscope	Ramanujam, Nimmi			December 2013	Completed	Cervical cancer affects the lives of 530,000 women worldwide each year and results in more than 270,000 deaths, with approximately 85% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. The decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries has been attributed to regular screening that relies on a multi-visit, cytology-based approach Pap Smear, followed at a later time by colposcopically directed biopsy when indicated, and treatment if necessary. Employing these methods requires dedicated clinic visits for specimen collection, follow up and treatment, as well as a pathology laboratory and skilled staff. Guidelines established by the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Protection (ACCP) on strategies for screening cervical cancer in resource-limited settings, have suggested visual inspection with acetic acid with low power magnification (VIAM) followed by identified cervical lesion treated with Loop Electrosurgical Procedure (LEEP) or cryo-therapy, as the most viable strategies for reducing the mortality associated with cervical cancer in the limited resource settings. In low and middle income countries, this three-tiered approach is not always practical due to the lack of infrastructure and resources and also due to patient attrition at each level of care. Therefore, there is a critical global need for an effective see and treat paradigm in a single visit in low-resource communities. Our solution is to integrate the imaging capabilities of colposcopy with a technique known as optical spectroscopy, which can rapidly measure oxygen saturation, neovascularization and the morphological composition of local tissue sites with a pen like probe. The colpospectroscope will enable surveillance with VIAM followed by spectroscopy (in lieu of biopsy and histology) such that cervical dysplasia can be diagnosed on the spot thereby enabling a see and treat paradigm for women with cervical pre-cancer with cryotherapy and/or LEEP in a single visit.

197	Feasibility Study of a Low-Cost, Portable, Fiberoptic Nasolaryngoscope for Early Screening and Detection of Head and Neck Cancers in Vietnam	Malkin, Robert			December 2013	Ongoing	Head and neck cancers (HNC) are the 6th most common cancer worldwide. These cancers are difficult to diagnose early due to the complex anatomy, lack of equipment, and limited expertise available for examination of the upper aerodigestive tract. These issues result in delayed diagnosis and high morbidity and mortality of advanced staged HNC. One solution to this problem is development of a low-cost, portable, fiberoptic nasolaryngoscope (FNS) that can allow for rapid screening and early detection of HNC. This project aims to test the feasibility of such a FNS in Vietnam. Within this proposal is a mentoring and education component to build the health care capacity of Vietnam. This will be done by training mid-level health care providers (i.e. nurses) to perform the examination. Photo documentation capability in the FNS will allow for consultation and review from otolaryngology specialists at the Vietnamese tertiary referral center as well as Duke University Medical Center. The results from this pilot will enable a larger scale proposal that will allow for distribution of the FNS to areas throughout Vietnam with trained mid-level health care providers trained in its use. Detection of HNC and other pathology can be referred to tertiary care centers, while persons with normal examinations can be clinically followed, thereby resulting in improved utilization of limited resources. The early detection of HNC will result in improved patient outcomes and survival. This work will be the model by which other low and middle income countries can improve detection and diagnosis of HNC.	Cancer,Engineering	Duke Global Health Institute	Duke NUS

200	RCT of an Integrated Treatment of Persons with Co-occurring HCV and Alcohol Abuse	Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean	United States		September 2013	Ongoing	For people infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol use increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and progressive liver fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. Integrated models of care that incorporate treatment for alcohol use, substance use, and mental health comorbidities have been called for, but few empirically tested models exist. In an R21 study, we developed and manualized an integrated behavioral-medical treatment model for patients with HCV who consume alcohol. We successfully implemented a standardized alcohol screening in a hepatology clinic using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) instrument; recruited 60 patients; retained participants in group and individual therapy; integrated care between an addictions specialist and medical providers; and achieved an 85% six-month interview response rate. The alcohol abstinence rate improved from 0% at baseline to 44% at 6 months. Mean Addiction Severity Index scores were reduced by 50% for alcohol from .24 to .12, and decreased for drug use from .05 to .03. The percentage of heavy drinkers decreased from 47% to 24% (Proeschold-Bell et al., 2011). We are conducting a randomized controlled trial that compares our six-month integrated treatment versus brief alcohol counseling in 230 HCV-infected patients with qualifying AUDIT alcohol scores at baseline. Participants in both arms will be treated at the Duke and UNC Liver Clinics and the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Outcome variables will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The aims are to: 1, evaluate alcohol abstinence; 2. determine differences in secondary outcomes between study arms; and 3. conduct a cost effectiveness analysis. We hypothesize that the intervention will significantly improve alcohol abstinence rates and significantly decrease relapse rates compared to the comparison. We further hypothesize that intervention participants will report fewer drinks per week and less illicit drug use than comparison participants, have fewer positive drug screens than comparison participants, and meet the $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained standard established in the health economics literature.

201	Development of Mental Health Treatment for Obstetric Fistula Patients in Tanzania	Watt, Melissa	Tanzania		September 2013	Ongoing	PI: Melissa Watt Co-investigator: Kathleen J. Sikkema Funder: NICHD, R21, 2013-2015 (Supplementary funding by the Fistula Foundation) Partner: KCMC in Moshi, TanzaniaObstetric fistula is a hole between the bladder and the vagina, which develops when obstructed labor is not relieved by cesarean section and results in uncontrollable leaking of urine and/or feces. The only cure for obstetric fistula is surgical repair, but many women suffer for years without treatment. Multiple studies have documented the social and psychological impact of obstetric fistula, which includes social isolation, stigma, depression, and mental health dysfunction. However, to date no intervention studies have evaluated empirically-supported therapies to assist in psychological healing among fistula patients. The proposed study aims to fill this gap by developing and pilot-testing a theoretically informed mental health intervention for women receiving surgical repair for obstetric fistula at KCMC Hospital in Moshi, Tanzania.The study has three specific aims: 1) To develop the nurse-delivered mental health intervention, built on theories of coping and cognitive behavioral therapy, 2) To assess feasibility and acceptability of implementing the intervention in the KCMC fistula ward, considering: intervention fidelity, patient satisfaction, provider feedback and cost of delivery, 3) To assess effectiveness of the intervention by comparing immediate and short term outcomes in 30 women who receive the experimental intervention with 30 women receiving the standard of care counseling, examining differences in primary outcomes (depression, PTSD and somatic symptoms) and secondary outcomes (coping, perceived stigma, social support, social participation, efficacy to engage with providers, adherence to clinical recommendations and social reintegration).This study is complete. The intervention development process was published in a paper in the journal Evaluation and Program Planning. There, we describe the 6-session individual-level intervention, based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and coping theory, that was developed for delivery by a community-health nurse. Intervention outcomes are reported in Pilot and Feasibility Studies. A nurse-delivered mental health intervention was feasible to implement as part of in-patient clinical care and regarded positively. There were sharp and meaningful improvements in mental health outcomes among participants over time, with no evidence of differences by condition.

204	One Health Innovation Fellowships for Zoonotic Disease Research In Mongolia		Mongolia		August 2013	Ongoing	Responding to the Framework Programs for Global Health Innovation, this proposal builds upon an established US-Mongolia multidisciplinary partnership to address zoonotic disease burdens in Mongolia. In recent decades, Mongolia has experienced major economic and environmental changes, and suffered many large epidemics of zoonotic diseases. The long term goal of this submission is to develop a global health training program that elicits innovative, multidisciplinary team problem-solving solutions to develop products, alter disease processes, and guide policies in controlling zoonotic diseases in low- or middle- income countries. In this effort, we will employ One Health cross-disciplinary training and foster collaborations in public, veterinary, and environmental health sectors for one American and two Mongolian postdoctoral trainees per year (2-yr training period). These professionals will comprise a 3-person 'One Health' team that represents each of the three health sectors. Over the 5-yr period, 4 such teams (12 postdoctoral fellows) will be engaged in zoonotic disease problem solving. In Phase I of the 2-yr period, teams will convene at Duke University (DU) for 2 months of training. They will receive 9 credit hours of One Health didactic training (Certificate in One Health) as well as training in ethical conduct of human and animal research. While in North Carolina, the postdoctoral teams will meet each week with a seven-member Internal Advisory Committee (IAC, 4 US and 3 Mongolian members) who will pose zoonotic disease problems and guide them in engaging diverse expert groups at DU in developing a pilot research project and budget. While in North Carolina, the postdoctoral team will pitch their zoonotic disease problems and their ideas for projects to various professional groups at DU (e.g. animal science, food safety, environmental engineers, ecologists, geographers, as well as emerging disease, public health, and veterinary health professionals) with a goal of identifying innovative solutions to the problem and identifying DU and later Mongolian research mentors. During the last week of Phase I training, the postdoctoral team will present their project to the IAC for final approval and research funding release. The postdoctoral team will then travel to Mongolia and set up a research headquarters in the most appropriate Mongolian government collaborating institution, and move forward with pilot study execution. While the postdoctoral team will have at least biweekly contact with their mentors and monthly contact with the IAC, this program will emphasize independent team problem solving by the postdoctoral fellows.* One Health training will help Mongolia respond to zoonotic disease threats * One Health research may help Mongolia alter public health policy	Environmental health,Epidemiology,Infectious diseases,Occupational health,One Health	NIH-Fogarty International Center	National Academy of Medical Sciences

207	Youth in Transition: Developmental Pathways to Risk and Resilience in South India		India		August 2013	Ongoing	It is well established that education leads to improved health outcomes in high income countries. The association between education and mental health, however, is less consistent in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Schooling can be a risk factor for adolescent mental health problems including suicide. This may be due to a combination of high expectations, extremely demanding academic environments, and a lack of available psychosocial resources: all factors that can be influenced by educational policy. However, empirical data elucidating the mechanisms connecting the educational context with mental health in such environments is lacking. The goal of our research for South India is two-fold: to develop hypotheses for the association among the school environment, life course models, and neuropsychological functioning. This study addresses the public health and education policy issue of the relationship between the educational environment and mental health employing three methodological perspectives: anthropology, pediatric neuropsychology, and social epidemiology. Our aim for this pilot study is to use ethnographic methods to develop a quantitative assessment of life-course models of protective and risk factors for adolescent well-being, which can be administered in on tablet computers in an innovative interface. We also gather information on the salient aspects of the youth's educational environment from the youth themselves as well as other key informants. The result of this study will be demonstration of conceptual significance and feasible administration of a life course assessment that can be used in larger studies testing hypotheses and piloting interventions across LMIC that minimize mental health risks and optimize mental health benefits of education.

208	Sociobehavioral Sciences Research to Improve Care for HIV Infection in Tanzania	Bartlett, John	Tanzania,United States		August 2013	Ongoing	Responding to Tanzanian National priorities for the prevention of HIV and the care of persons living with HIV, Duke University and the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) is developing a Sociobehavioral Sciences (SBS) Core at KCMC focused on HIV/AIDS. SBS research skills are essential for understanding critical issues relating to HIV testing, linkage and retention in care, treatment adherence, and co-morbidities such as mental illness and substance abuse, which relate strongly to clinical outcomes. Their research will expand existing collaborative research efforts under the leadership of the newly developed KCMC SBS Core Team. Given the goal of research independence and creation of a regional training facility for the Team by April 2018, we have developed a plan for team composition which emphasizes robust and complementary SBS research skills. Five candidates will begin PhD training in year 1, pursuing expertise in epidemiology/public health, health promotion/behavior, psychology, biomedical engineering/rapid diagnostics, and biostatistics. In subsequent years additional team members will initiate medium- and short-term training to develop expertise in psychiatry, public health aspects of mental illness, nursing, data management and research administration. Strong mentorship will be offered by faculty at Duke University and the training sites, through their expertise and funded research in SBS aspects of HIV infection. Program administration will build upon the past training successes of the KCMC-Duke collaboration, and future success will be ensured through careful communication, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and accountability to the Training Advisory Committee and an External Advisory Committee.

209	An Innovative Model for Detecting Interspecies Disease Transmission and Novel Pathogen Detection at Lola Ya Bonobo Sanctuary, Democratic Republic of Congo	Woods, Chris			June 2013	Ongoing	Recent studies have highlighted Central Africa as an emerging infections hotspot and African apes as a reservoir of pathogens posing risk to humans. We will harness a uniquely skilled team to pilot an index-cluster study for detection of interspecies disease transmission at Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We will focus on respiratory viruses given the transmissibility, sample accessibility, and potential for global distribution. We will establish surveillance for symptomatic respiratory illness among humans and bonobos (Index Cases). For each of five separate index events, we will serially sample (5 days) a contact cluster of 5 bonobos and 5 human staff to determine secondary attack rate and risk factors for transmission. The Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa will process samples and perform screening studies. We will detect known viruses from respiratory samples using an established multiplex PCR algorithm in Durham, NC and create a biorepository for biomarkers of early disease and pathogen discovery. Veterinary history of the sanctuary bonobos suggests we will document pathogen transmission between and among the sanctuary bonobos and the animal care staff. We will use the generated data to apply for focused grant opportunities with plans to extend our work to sanctuaries across Central Africa and expand our epidemiological and diagnostic queries. Our ultimate goal is to gain unprecedented access to the little studied primate and human populations where Duke is uniquely positioned to be a leader in emerging human and primate disease surveillance.

211	Engaging Undergraduates in Research: Dietary intake, weight status and cognition in primary school children in the WISER educational programs in Muhuru Bay, Kenya	Broverman, Sherryl	Kenya		June 2013	Ongoing	This grant creates a team of undergraduates, graduate students, Kenyan research assistants, and faculty to examine the associations between nutritional intake, body weight, and cognition in primary school children in rural Western Kenya. The majority of children in this area experience food insecurity and consume inadequate calories, and overall diet quality is poor. Given the relationship between nutritional status and academic outcomes, a nutrition-based project should enhance cognition in children, leading to overall better educational outcomes. Our proposed baseline data will allow us to better identify the specific nutrition-related problems that should be targeted in the development of a school-based garden intervention. Further, possible future studies evaluating the effects of a school-based garden intervention may help provide more rigorous, much needed evidence for the effect of gardens on nutritional status, dietary intake and cognition in low resource countries. The project has two primary objectives: 1. build research capacity in undergraduate students and Kenyan partners as part of a larger team; an 2. collect pilot data for a larger grant proposal to external funders. Our long-term goals are to develop a school-based garden intervention, and then assess the effect of the program on nutritional status, dietary intake and cognitive ability in primary school children in a randomized controlled study over a three-year period.Sustainable school-based gardens are an under explored intervention for improving nutrition and cognitive growth in children.

212	Validation of High Road Utilizer Surveys as a Source for Vulnerable Road User Road Traffic Crash Hotspot Localization	Staton, Catherine	Sri Lanka,Rwanda		June 2013	Ongoing	Injuries kill nearly 6 million people worldwide annually with another approximately 650 million people worldwide living with disabilities due to injury. The World Bank predicts that due to further economic development and increased motorization, global road traffic deaths will rise by more than 35% from 2010 to 2020. Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists bear a disproportionate share of the injury burden. Similarly, those from low and middle income countries have the highest burden of injury related mortality and morbidity and these locations are the least financially equipped, have the greatest challenges in providing care, the weakest evidence base to guide interventions, and the fewest resources, policies or infrastructure to institute effective change. This project focuses on identifying locations with high incidents of road traffic crashes (RTCs) that might be amenable to prevention initiatives. By using Geographic Information Systems in Galle, Sri Lanka and Kigali, Rwanda, this project utilizes and compares crowd-sourced data from high utilizer groups of VRUs to a police dataset to determine hot spots for VRU RTCs. At the conclusion of the project, we will have determined hotspots and built environment characteristics of VRU RTCs in two study locations utilizing both surveys and police datasets. We will have compared and contrasted the data, experiences in implementing the project, and methods used in both locations in order to develop an implementation plan for other locations. General Objective: Validation of high road utilizer surveys as a data source for GIS/spatial analysis of RTC among VRUs in Sri Lanka and Rwanda Specific Objectives: 1. Determine the location of hot spots for VRU RTC based on existing police records 2. Determine location of hot spots for VRU RTC based on high road utilizer surveys (%u201Ccrowd-sourcing%u201D) 3. Determine the association between spatial analysis of hotspot location by survey and by police data 4. Compare and contrast data and experiences from Sri Lanka and RwandaWe have had numerous abstracts presented at US and international international conferences including our Sri Lankan colleagues presenting an abstract at the European Society of Emergency Medicine in Torino, Italy October 2015 on our Sri Lankan results. We have two papers submitted on these results and 3 nearly ready for submission.	Injuries	Duke Global Health Institute		
213	"Exploring the Emerging Concept of ""Social Responsibility of the Global Health Researcher"" Through Interactive Video"	Stewart, Kearsley	Tanzania	http://sites.globalhealth.duke.edu/gh-rcr-video-training/	April 2013	Completed	In the United States, training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is required for most global health researchers. As low-and middle-income countries develop their own research protocols and portfolios, RCR and research ethics training are increasingly central to this process. In collaboration with faculty, staff, and students of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, I have developed a series of five 5-minute research ethics training videos, available here. The scripts for these video scenarios are based on culturally relevant issues in research, identified during focus group discussions and interviews. Issues raised include community distrust of externally-funded research projects, power dynamics of collaborative research between US and Tanzania colleagues, and the broader social impact of research at the community level.

214	Monsoon Science: Epidemiology in the Time of Climate Change	Solomon, Harris	India		March 2013	Completed	I am conducting a pilot ethnographic project on the role of epidemiological knowledge in India in the context of climate change. Humanities researchers have rapidly scaled up their engagement in issues of climate change, in a time when human impacts on the environment have taken on new political significance. Concurrently, epidemiologists have intensified their questions of the relations between climatic shifts, weather-related disasters, and burdens of morbidity and mortality. The global health outcomes at stake in this context transcend matters of the infectious and the chronic. They are, as Bruno Latour has written, questions about the politics of nature: how nature (and its turbulence) inflects the practices of research and knowledge gathering. As such, numbers serve as more than mere proof; they also tie together diverse actors and agendas. Epidemiology is the science of disease distribution and causation is one of the key sites to assess the cultural, political, and social dimensions of such ties. As a medical anthropologist of urban India, I plan to situate my ethnographic research in the context of a climatic phenomenon that literally suffuses all forms of life in Mumbai: the monsoon. I am broadly interested in the practice of epidemiologists during the monsoon, when health statistics circulate as front-page news and become matters of everyday conversation. I am also interested in the very local work that Mumbai's epidemiologists do: they must speak for the city in relation to India's broader health statistical trends, but must also make claims about what makes Mumbai unique in terms of collecting and reporting disease data. This project thus examines how experts in Mumbai understand and express the relationship between health and the environment. Ultimately, this project will offer a grounded, ethnographic, person-centered account of the emergent field of global environmental health, while it also will narrate the story of India's epidemiologists in action.

215	Improving Vision and Quality of Life: An innovative and comprehensive eye care model for individuals in residential care facilities	Finkelstein, Eric			January 2013	Ongoing	To date, Australia does not have a comprehensive eye health service model for those living in residential care facilities. To address this gap, we have developed a novel model of eye care for people living in residential care facilities. We have pilot tested this new model and our initial results suggest that it has the potential to be an effective eye care model for managing vision impairment and improving QoL for this subset of the Australian population. In this study, we assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this new model of eye care for older people across several residential care facilities.	Health care access			
216	Developing a rapid assessment tool to identify bottlenecks to malaria prevention for elimination	Prudhomme O'Meara, Wendy	Kenya		January 2013	Ongoing	"Project Summary: International efforts to scale up malaria control have achieved considerable success and have pointed toward the possibility of global malaria eradication. Achieving the long-term goal of eradication requires effective implementation of current tools, development of new technologies, and ongoing surveillance of the successes and failures of both. As malaria transmission declines and becomes increasingly heterogeneous, a finer-grained picture of malaria burden and intervention efficacy is required. In Kenya, considerable reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality have been reported, but success has not been uniform. In Bungoma East district in western Kenya, data suggest that control efforts have not had the expected impact; despite the fact that ITN ownership exceeds 70%, malaria infection and morbidity remain high. The observation that malaria burden has not responded to control measures suggests a breakdown in effectiveness of ITN, but not due to simply to ownership, a common measure of coverage. Breakdown in prevention of malaria may be due to a number of different factors in addition to coverage, including improper use and low adherence by households, changing vector populations and reduced susceptibility of the vector. In the first phase of the proposed project, we want to answer the question of why malaria morbidity has remained alarmingly high in an area with high coverage of effective interventions. We will use the efficacy decay framework to quantify barriers to effective prevention. In the second phase, we want to apply the lessons from phase 1 towards developing a tool that can generate local, timely information in a cost-effective manner to identify and address barriers to elimination. Specific Aim 1: Quantify the efficacy decay at each step using case-control methodology. We will use a case control study to estimate the relative contribution of each step in the efficacy decay of ITNs to malaria prevention in an area where coverage is high but malaria burden has remained resistant to control measures. Specific Aim 2: Develop a rapid assessment tool that can be implemented at sentinel health facilities to identify local bottlenecks to malaria elimination. Based on the results of the efficacy decay analysis, we will develop a tool that can be used by community health workers to identify local barriers to effective prevention and stimulate local solutions.J.N.

218	Use of Conjoint Analysis to Estimate Cost-Effective Strategies for Increasing Screening Rates for Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Programs	Finkelstein, Eric	Singapore		December 2012	Ongoing	Many Singaporeans do not undertake screenings consistent with recommended guidelines. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of key factors that guide the decision of whether or not to use cancer screening services and determine how to cost-effectively increase the reach of the programs. We are conducting focus groups in order to identify the key factors that drive the decision to attend a screening exam. Conjoint analysis methods will then be used to estimate the relative importance of each of these factors and the extent to which modest incentives, targeted information and other strategies identified via the focus groups are expected to increase screening uptake. We are also giving special attention to the identification of potential knowledge gaps and misconceptions about cancer screening.	Cancer

220	Health, Environmental, and Climate Impacts of Household Energy Choices in India	Pattanayak, Subhrendu	India		December 2012	Ongoing	Biomass burning for cooking in underdeveloped countries can negatively affect at least three kinds of outcomes: the health of cooks and their families (because of indoor air pollution), the quality of local forests from where the wood is collected, and the global climate (because of black carbon emissions). However, there is scarce data from rigorously conducted empirical studies to support the promotion of new household energy technologies to deliver triple benefits to health and livelihood, the environment, and climate. We report on the progress made on a rigorous study of the impacts of biogas technology. Using pilot funding by Duke's Problem-Focused Interdisciplinary Research-Scholarship Teams (PFIRST) program, we have completed the first phase of this research comprised of two sub-phases: (1) socioeconomic surveys of 500 households from 4 different strata of potential exposure to ambient and indoor air pollution, and (2) measurement of indoor air pollution, outdoor air pollution, and objective health (lung function and blood pressure) in a subset of 100 households. This project will expand our research to (a) conduct a pilot social intervention to sustain biogas use and thereby maintain our cohort, and (b) collect additional health parameters (e.g., pulse oximetry) and biological materials (e.g., buccal swabs and urine) to evaluate host genetics as well as markers of oxidative stress from the primary cooks in the same 100 households. This second phase of research will allow us to begin to characterize the mechanisms and nature of health damage and to propose interventions that will deliver the triple benefits. This project provides an opportunity to a multi-disciplinary team from across the campus to work as a team, develop international partnerships, and lay the foundation for future proposals that will enable the development of a vibrant research program on the critical issue of energy poverty and access in the 21st century.

225	Chloroquine as a Chemopreventation of Burkitts Lymphoma in Holoendemic Areas	Chao, Nelson	Tanzania		November 2012	Ongoing	This project is to plan a chemoprevention trial for Burkitt's lymphoma in East Africa (Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania). Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) is the most common pediatric cancer in areas of equatorial Africa where malaria is endemic. It has long been known that there is a relationship between malaria and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection in the genesis of eBL. The increased viral load and the concomitant polyclonal B cell activation with enhanced B cell survival may augment the risk of eBL development in children living in malaria-endemic areas. Oncogenes such as Myc cooperate with loss of function mutations in the Atm-p53 pathway to accelerate tumorigenesis. Therefore, agents targeting this pathway might influence the outcome of Myc-induced tumor formation. There have been previous attempts to prevent eBL by using malarial prophylaxis. Geser et al. conducted a clinical trial with chloroquine in North Mara District, Tanzania. Immediately after initiation of this suppression trial, the incidence of malaria fell but soon it rose again to pretrial levels in spite of continued chloroquine administration. However, they found that during the years of chloroquine distribution, the incidence rate of eBL there fell by about 75% and stayed low until two years after the end of the study. Recent data from the Kastan lab has demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine blocks recycling of energy and MYC-mediated lymphomagenesis. Intermittent chloroquine use effectively prevents cancer in mouse models of two human cancer syndromes, Burkitt's lymphoma and ataxia telangiectasia, suggesting that agents targeting lysosome-mediated degradation may be effective in cancer prevention. Given these new data, one possible interpretation of the Geser trial results is a direct effect of chloroquine on the tumor cells as the primary mechanism of reducing the incidence of eBL. We are conducting a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that administration of chloroquine will reduce the incidence of eBL via inhibition of autophagy salvage pathways in tumor cell lysosomes. We are collecting current and historical data on eBL incidence and then define treatment and control populations. During the treatment and follow up phases we will collect data on incidence of eBL and malaria and collect specimens to look for biomarkers of drug activity, and measure viral and malarial loads by PCR.Cancer Center Development in Mwanza	Cancer	Duke Global Health Institute		
226	Carolina Drug and Alcohol Resources (CADRE)	LeGrand, Sara	United States		September 2012	Ongoing	Substance abuse is associated with negative health outcomes including greater HIV risk behavior among both HIV negative and positive individuals. The purpose of this program is to provide a comprehensive continuum of substance abuse services from pretreatment to aftercare for individuals with HIV and minority men who have sex with men (MSM) regardless of HIV status in a Southern state highly affected by HIV. The program is expected to address the negative impacts of substance use on health outcomes, adherence, services utilization and HIV risk behavior. The primary aim of the Carolina Alcohol and Drug Resources (CADRE) project is to enhance and expand the substance abuse services provided in the SAMHSA-funded Carolina Alcohol and Drug Expansion Team (CADET) program, which provided comprehensive substance abuse care for individuals with HIV living primarily in the Durham NC area. Services will be enhanced by adding peer outreach and navigation services to improve treatment engagement and participation and expanded to replicate the enhanced CADET service model in Charlotte NC and to add HIV/Hepatitis testing and care linkage and substance abuse care for minority MSM regardless of HIV status at both sites. The Charlotte Metropolitan area had the 10th highest HIV diagnosis rate in the US in 2009. Our secondary aims are to: 1. increase the infrastructure of the targeted communities to provide a seamless continuum of substance use and HIV/Hepatitis care through education and community collaboration 2. determine the effect of the comprehensive substance abuse care services on outcomes including substance use, mental health, and HIV treatment adherence, HIV risk behavior, and access and utilization of substance abuse and HIV services and 3. determine the effect of the comprehensive substance use program on outcomes for minority MSM including on substance use, knowledge of HIV/Hepatitis status and service use. The target population is minority individuals, primarily African-Americans, with HIV or at high-risk for HIV with a particular focus on minority MSMs. We plan to serve a total of 315 individuals (45 individuals in the first year and 90 per year for years 2 through 4). For individuals who are HIV-positive, we will provide one year of comprehensive services including: 1. peer outreach and peer navigation to facilitate and enhance treatment engagement, 2. individual and group substance abuse treatment using evidence-based models including our empirically validated modified intensive outpatient program (mIOP), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and Cognitive Behavior Therapy 3. ongoing recovery groups for individuals who have completed the intensive substance abuse treatment phase and 4. linkage to needed services such as case management, psychiatric care, HIV/Hepatitis medical care. We are also targeting services for minority MSM of unknown HIV status to increase access and utilization of substance use services and identify HIV and Hepatitis status. These services will include HIV/Hepatitis testing and counseling, substance use treatment, peer navigation, ongoing substance abuse recovery groups and linkage to social services and other needed care.Over 130 people have been enrolled and received some level of substance abuse treatment and/or supportive services to access substance abuse treatment in the first year and a half of service provision; topical treatment groups have been developed to meet the complex needs of this client population, and new access points for HIV and hepatitis C testing have been established. Preliminary data indicate that participants in CADRE experience improved mental health outcomes and reduced substance use.If proven effective, CADRE will provide new models of substance use treatment for people living with AIDS that incorporates peers support and social support to improve treatment outcomes.

228	Evaluating the impact of mercury contamination on human and environmental welfare in the Madre de Dios / Beni Watersheds in Peru and Bolivia	Pan, William	Bolivia,Peru		September 2012	Ongoing	The long-term goal of this project is to quantify and evaluate the impact of methyl mercury exposures on human and environmental welfare in the Madre de Dios (MDD) / Beni watershed of the lower Amazon Basin located in the regions of MDD (Peru) and Pando (Bolivia). The project offers a unique opportunity for Duke faculty and students to engage in a research study with geo-political, economic, human health and environmental implications through government and non-government partnerships we have fostered. The MDD/Pando region is facing major emerging environmental and health threats due to rapid increases in artisanal gold mining, road development, and agricultural expansion. The region is the among the most economically disadvantaged in Latin America, though in the last few years it has seen much immigration as people are lured by the economic promise of participating in gold mining and processing, an illegal but rapidly growing sector of the economy. Artisanal mining has a potentially devastating impact on human and environmental welfare due to the use of mercury in the amalgamation of gold. To date, no research has delineated the extent of mercury contamination in the MDD/Beni watershed, nor the impact on fishing as an economic livelihood or on the overall health of indigenous and non-indigenous populations in the region.We aim to fill this gap by implementing three objectives: (1) measuring mercury accumulation in river sediment and fish; (2) evaluating the impact of human mercury exposure; and (3) developing sediment transport models to identify where conservation efforts can be focused.

232	SNA - Pathways to Health and Well-Being: Social Networks of Orphaned and Abandoned Youth	Whetten, Kathryn	Cambodia,Tanzania,Kenya,Ethiopia,United States		April 2012	Ongoing	Little is known about the social and sexual network features of orphan and abandoned children (OAC), yet network differences may contribute to low educational attainment, inappropriate employment, and high-risk sexual behavior, and ultimately put OAC at risk for HIV infection. The long-term goal of this research is to determine key intervenable factors that contribute to OAC disadvantage or resilience, in order to construct viable interventions for promoting OAC health and well-being. The overall objective in this application is to assess OAC social and sexual network composition and variability, and determine how network features are associated with low education, income-generation, and HIV-risk behaviors. The central hypothesis for this work is that the social and sexual networks of OAC are small with low variability and these network features translate into reduced access to educational support, fewer positive employment opportunities and increased sexual risk-behavior. This hypothesis is based upon preliminary research suggesting variability in the size and heterogeneity of OAC education- and employment-related networks. The central hypothesis will be tested by collecting and analyzing both social and sexual network data within the data collection infrastructure of an existing NIH-funded OAC cohort: the positive outcomes for orphans (POFO) study. POFO is in the first of its five-year continuation funding, which will allow this proposed research to collect longitudinal network and outcome data (at two time points). Aim #1a: identify the composition and variance social network characteristics of OAC, including educational and employment-related supports; and Aim #1b: identify the sexual network composition and variance characteristics of OAC, using a network analysis approach for both sub-aims. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that OAC's networks are small with limited variability. Aim #2: assess the association between the social network characteristics and health-related outcomes (education, income-generation) and between the sexual network characteristics and HIV-risk outcomes using multilevel modeling with network data. The working hypothesis for this aim is that OAC social and sexual network features are associated with low levels of success in staying in school, obtaining appropriate employment, and high sexual risk-behavior (e.g., age at sexual debut, number of sexual partners, characteristics of sexual partners). Completing the proposed research will impact the lives of OAC by: 1) establishing if OAC network features account for success in educational, income generation, and sexual risk-taking behaviors; 2) providing the basis for interventions to mitigate damage done to OAC to prevent further disenfranchisement as OAC enter their adult lives, and 3) ensuring these OAC have the chance to achieve their full potential. Because this cohort of OAC are transitioning out of structured care settings into their adult lives, this work must be conducted now before they disappear within the context of poverty and disadvantage that characterizes so many orphaned and abandoned children today.High levels of stigma toward orphaned children, regardless of cause, were found, and more so if HIV was the cause of parental death. Stigma includes beliefs that orphaned and separated children (OSC) cannot be treated like biological children, that OSC should feel grateful to have any family take them in, and that it is acceptable to treat them as servants to compensate for the care they receive. Policy implications are that orphan related stigma is serious, and that reintegration programs and interventions failing to target broader social stigma, or only HIV stigma, may be ineffective.

236	Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) to Determine HIV Testing Preference in Tanzania (R21)		Tanzania,United States	http://chpir.org/_homepage-content/research/feasibility-discrete-choice/	February 2012	Ongoing	"Universal HIV testing and immediate treatment of HIV-infected individuals could dramatically reduce the HIV epidemic, yet HIV testing uptake in sub-Saharan Africa remains low. In Tanzania, despite improved availability of HIV testing options, nearly two thirds of adults have never tested for HIV. Novel HIV testing options specifically designed to match the preferences of high-risk and hard-to-reach populations hold the potential to improve the acceptability and uptake of HIV testing. To extend our previous work, which assessed uptake of HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) across varied venues in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania (free-standing, mobile, home-based, and clinic-based VCT), we proposed to apply an innovative method for preference elicitation known as Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs, sometimes referred to as conjoint analysis) to HIV testing in this region. Grounded in the economic theory of utility maximization, the DCE method identifies key modifiable features of HIV testing options, presents survey respondents with various combinations of these features (each representing a hypothetical HIV testing option), and asks them to choose their preferred alternatives. Responses are analyzed to estimate the relative value placed on individual testing features, and to determine what combinations of features most influence decision-making and uptake. This project was implemented with additional funding from the Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).To-date, the joint project (R21 and CFAR) has generated 3 published manuscripts: Ostermann J, Njau B, Mtuy T, Brown D, Muehlbacher A.

HIV Testing Preferences in Tanzania: A Qualitative Exploration of the Importance of Confidentiality, Accessibility, and Quality of Service. BMC Public Health. 2014:838. doi:10.1186/1471-2458-14-838. Additional manuscripts are in preparation. In addition, an R01 application was scored (6th percentile) that seeks to test the relationship between stated preferences and revealed preferences (i.e., actual testing decisions) in a randomized controlled trial. In ""HIV testing preferences in Tanzania: a qualitative exploration of the importance of confidentiality, accessibility, and quality of service"", published in BMC Public Health, we describe our use of in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) to identify which characteristics of HIV testing options most influence testing decisions. IDIs and FGDs with diverse community members, including men and women who had previously tested for HIV and those who had not, were used to develop a concept map of preference-relevant features of testing options, and to prioritize features with respect to their expected influence on testing decisions. Using the results of the qualitative work, we developed a DCE for HIV testing. In two pilot studies and iterative pre-tests, we narrowed the number of HIV testing features evaluated in the DCE to five characteristics: distance to testing, confidentiality, testing days (weekday vs. weekend), method for obtaining the sample for testing (blood from finger or arm, oral swab), and availability of HIV medications at the testing site. The DCE was programmed into iPads and administered to 486 community members enrolled using cluster-randomization and Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) sampling methods. Mixed logit analyses of DCE choice data identified distance to testing as the most important attribute to participants, followed by confidentiality and the method for obtaining the sample for the HIV test. In ""Heterogeneous HIV testing preferences in an urban setting in Tanzania: Results from a Discrete Choice Experiment"", published in PLoS ONE, we highlighted significant variation in preferences among participants, and the potential benefits of tailoring HIV testing interventions to match the preferences of specific sub-populations. We subsequently used respondent-driven sampling methods to recruit 162 female barworkers and 194 male mountain porters and administered the same DCE survey. Seed participants were recruited from barworkers presenting for a health check-up at a municipal health center and from climbing companies and a porters union. In ""One size does not fit all: HIV testing preferences differ among high-risk groups in Northern Tanzania,"" published in AIDS Care, we compare HIV risk characteristics and preferences of these two high risk groups to those of the randomly selected community sample. Barworkers and porters exhibited significantly elevated risk profiles, and bivariate analyses of survey responses and mixed logit analyses of DCE choice data demonstrated significant variation in testing preferences between groups. On average, distance was less important to high-risk groups than to randomly selected community members. Barworkers were more reluctant to test at home and had a stronger preference for venipuncture than other female community members. Porters placed more value than other males on the availability of HIV medications at the testingOur study demonstrated that rigorously designed and implemented DCEs can identify distinctly different sets of HIV testing preferences across and within diverse HIV risk groups in a resource-poor setting. Our R01 application seeks to help to address persistent low testing rates by identifying the stated HIV testing preferences of FBW and KMP (Aim 1), by identifying HIV testing options that are expected to better match the preferences of these populations than existing options (Aim 2), and by linking a preference-informed HIV testing intervention to actual rates of testing in the context of a pragmatic RCT (Aim 3)."

237	WISER, The Women's Institute for Secondary Education and Research	Broverman, Sherryl	Kenya	http://www.wisergirls.org/	January 2012	Ongoing	WISER is a community development organization focusing on the social empowerment of underprivileged girls through education and health. Specific objectives are to: * To increase the social empowerment of girls orphaned by AIDS as they prepare to transition to adult life. * To reduce HIV risk and unplanned pregnancies of girls orphaned by AIDS by reducing the need for transactional sex or relationships due to low self-esteem. * To support and coordinate post-graduation education and training for orphans interested in entering the health care workforce.WISER works with a population of girls at high risk for HIV infection, early pregnancy, and child marriages. Girls involved in our intervention have a 90% reduction in pregnancy rates and HIV risk compared to control groups, have improved mental health, and transition to healthy adulthood with education or employment.WISER has demonstrated that reducing school-related gender based violence has a significant impact on the academic and health outcomes of adolescent girls.

238	A Randomized Trial of Economic Incentives to Promote Walking among Full Time Employees	Finkelstein, Eric	Singapore		January 2012	Ongoing	There is overwhelming evidence that increased physical activity confers a variety of health benefits, yet recent survey data reveal that full time employees over age 35 are among the least active subsets of the Singaporean population. Employers in Singapore are increasingly looking to economic incentives to encourage healthy behaviors among employees although the evidence base justifying the use of these programs is limited. We are addressing this gap by: 1. assessing the reach and sustainability of employer-based walking programs through a stated preference conjoint analysis, 2. quantify the effectiveness of a 6 month walking program, and 3. determine the cost-effectiveness of a scalable incentive-driven employer based walking program both with and without incentives.

240	Discrete Choice Experiments to Determine HIV Testing Preference in Tanzania (Duke-CFAR)		Tanzania,United States	http://chpir.org/_homepage-content/research/feasibility-discrete-choice/	November 2011	Completed	"This project was implemented in conjunction with an NIMH-funded R21. CFAR and R21 funding were used to demonstrate the feasibility of using a form of stated preference (SP) survey research known as Discrete Choice Experiment (DCEs) in the context of HIV testing in a resource-poor setting. The DCE method, sometimes referred to as conjoint analysis, is used to determine which characteristics (or attributes) of good or service most influence respondents' choices or decision-making. Practically this method can be used to identify HIV testing strategies that combine diverse attributes in configurations that are not currently available. One aim of the CFAR component of the study was to use qualitative methods to prioritize characteristics of HIV testing options with respect to their expected influence on testing decision; the results were used in to design and implemented the DCE among randomly selected community members as part of the R21. CFAR funds were further used to recruit, and conduct additional DCE surveys with, two high-risk populations in the study area: female barworkers (FBW) and male Kilimanjaro mountain porters (KMP). The goal was to compare the HIV testing preferences of high-risk populations to those of the general population.To-date, the joint project has generated 3 published manuscripts: Ostermann J, Njau B, Mtuy T, Brown D, Muehlbacher A.

Additional manuscripts are in preparation. In addition, an R01 application was scored (6th percentile) that seeks to test the relationship between stated preferences and revealed preferences (i.e., actual testing decisions) in a randomized controlled trial. In ""HIV testing preferences in Tanzania: a qualitative exploration of the importance of confidentiality, accessibility, and quality of service"", published in BMC Public Health, we describe our use of in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) to identify which characteristics of HIV testing options most influence testing decisions. IDIs and FGDs with diverse community members, including men and women who had previously tested for HIV and those who had not, were used to develop a concept map of preference-relevant features of testing options, and to prioritize features with respect to their expected influence on testing decisions. Using the results of the qualitative work, we developed a DCE for HIV testing. In two pilot studies and iterative pre-tests, we narrowed the number of HIV testing features evaluated in the DCE to five characteristics: distance to testing, confidentiality, testing days (weekday vs. weekend), method for obtaining the sample for testing (blood from finger or arm, oral swab), and availability of HIV medications at the testing site. The DCE was programmed into iPads and administered to 486 community members enrolled using cluster-randomization and Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) sampling methods. Mixed logit analyses of DCE choice data identified distance to testing as the most important attribute to participants, followed by confidentiality and the method for obtaining the sample for the HIV test.

242	A RCT of Ways to Improve OVC HIV Prevention and Well Being (JHU)	Whetten, Kathryn			September 2011	Ongoing	"This grant will conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions. OVC will receive either 1) a ""gold standard"" model of PS (Psychosocial Counseling: PC) which is an expanded version of what is currently being provided in some of the best PS programming for OVC affected by HIV; or 2) TF-CBT which is an evidence-based CBT approach studied in Zambia and Tanzania. Comparative outcomes will include measures of HIV risk behaviors, emotional and behavioral health, and overall well-being and health development of OVC affected by HIV/AIDS.High levels of stigma toward orphaned children, regardless of cause, were found, and more so if HIV was the cause of parental death. Stigma includes beliefs that orphaned and separated children (OSC) cannot be treated like biological children, that OSC should feel grateful to have any family take them in, and that it is acceptable to treat them as servants to compensate for the care they receive. Policy implications are that orphan related stigma is serious, and that reintegration programs and interventions failing to target broader social stigma, or only HIV stigma, may be ineffective."

244	The Impact and Social Ecology of Bacterial Zoonoses in Northern Tanzania: Understanding Transmission Patterns Among Humans, Livestock and Wildlife Hosts	Crump, John	Tanzania		September 2011	Ongoing	In northern Tanzania, febrile disease caused by the zoonotic pathogens, Leptospira, Coxiella and Brucella spp., account for 11 times more febrile admissions than malaria. These pathogens can infect and be transmitted among a wide range of host species. However, almost nothing is known about transmission patterns among animal hosts, which host species are responsible for transmission to humans, or the key social, economic and behavioral determinants of human disease risk in different agro-ecological settings. This project integrates several disciplinary approaches, including social behavioral studies, human febrile illness surveillance, and linked human-animal epidemiological studies, to generate data for incorporation into models of human disease risk. These models, together with an understanding of community risk perception and knowledge allows us to identify appropriate strategies for disease control and prevention.

251	Population-environment Dynamics Influencing Malaria Risk in the Peruvian Amazon	Pan, William	Peru		June 2011	Completed	The objectives of this project are to expand training and knowledge in the field of population, environment and health dynamics toward the goal of becoming an expert and independent investigator in this growing field. Dr. Pan will build upon his experience and expertise in household and use, biostatistics, multilevel modeling and spatial analysis by obtaining training in remote sensing (RS), ecology (vector ecology and biogeography), and malaria epidemiology. This new set of skills and knowledge will be obtained through a well-defined career development plan consisting of coursework, directed readings, and mentored research. Coursework and readings will be conducted in all areas, with a particular focus on RS and ecology. An expert group of mentors and collaborators have committed themselves to helping Dr. Pan achieve his goal and provide guidance for his proposed Mentored Research. The long-term objectives are: 1. Identify household, community, and infrastructure factors associated with land use and land cover (LULC); and 2. Determine the extent to which LULC, and determinants thereof, are associated with malaria vector presence and human malaria risk towards the eventual control and eradication of P. vivax. The project tests the central hypothesis that community settlement areas have more diverse LULC, less land cleared, and better environmental management than areas managed by nearby labor camps; and therefore, malaria vector density will be greater in areas managed by labor camps than by household settlers. To achieve the objectives and test hypotheses, the study combines a population-environment and vector ecology study in the northern Peruvian Amazon along the Mazan and Napo Rivers. Data to be combined include survey information from households and key informants in communities and labor camps, locational data of relevant infrastructure and transportation networks, a time series of RS images, and a longitudinal sample of bodies of water to collect malaria vector larvae. Spatially-explicit models using traditional and Bayesian multilevel frameworks will be specified to test hypotheses. The findings from this study will have a wide impact on malaria prevention and control programs throughout Latin America.There are several policy implications for this study: 1. Distribution and infectivity of anophelines along a newly constructed road compared to established communities near rivers. This will help identify more accurate prevention methods. 2. Evaluation of multilevel risk factors of malaria infection, namely, how infrastructure and household behavior interact to influence malaria risk 3.

252	Assessing Risk Factors for Obesity in Young Children in Northern Mexico (Juega)		Mexico		May 2011	Ongoing	The primary aim of the Juega study is to assess the extent to which physical activity, inactivity, and sleep duration are associated with child adiposity in a sample of 100 children entering their first year of school in Ensenada and Tijuana, Mexico. These cities are known for their high rates of drug-related violence, and thus, children may not be as physically active as those in other cities in the country. Energy expenditure and sleep duration have a demonstrated relationship to obesity, but little is known about these behaviors in children in Mexico--especially in young children. Families completed a questionnaire at baseline (before school begins) and follow-up (after completion of the first year of school). During these same time points, we ask children to wear an activity monitor coupled with a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, to better understand activity levels and the context for that activity. This study began in summer 2012 and is ongoing.	Pediatrics,Cardiovascular disease,Obesity,Nutrition	Duke Global Health Institute	University Autonoma de Baja California

260	Qualitative Supplement to IMATCHINE Project	Mohanan, Manoj	India		July 2010	Ongoing	The IMATCHINE project is an evaluation of ongoing voucher and conditional cash transfer programs for obstetric care in the private sector, in Gujarat and Karnataka respectively, using quasi-experimental and experimental research designs to understand the impact of these subsidy programs on utilization of services and also on health outcomes. The project also includes a large cluster randomized trial, in Karnataka, of supply side incentives for providers based on improvements in quality of care or improvements in population health outcomes. While the quantitative evaluation will focus on estimating the impact of the financial incentives on obstetric and neonatal outcomes, the qualitative component aims to inform the mechanisms through which these impacts might be driven. The qualitative research components will help answer the following broad questions: 1. What motivates private-sector providers of Ob-Gyn services in rural Karnataka to do their routine work in the first place? 2. How do the motivating factors inform the development of non-financial incentives? 3. How are financial incentives going to play out in light of these motivating factors? 4. What do providers do to improve quality of care or improve population health outcomes in response to financial and non-financial incentives? A critical piece of this study aims to understand how the practices of private-sector providers have changed after the introduction of supply-side financial and non-financial incentives as part of the IMATCHINE cluster randomized experiment. Examples of questions of interest include: What have providers actually done in order to deliver demonstrably higher quality results? What accountability mechanisms, formal or informal, are involved in these modes of service delivery? What types of intermediaries, if any, are involved?

263	Training for the Prevention and Treatment of Stroke in China	Laskowitz, Daniel	China		July 2010	Ongoing	"In response to the Millennium Promise Awards (PAR-08-175; Non-communicable Chronic Diseases Research Training Program) the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI PD/Pl: Daniel Laskowitz, MD), the Duke Global Health Institute (DGHI Pl: Michael Merson, MD), the Duke Stroke Center (DSC Pl: Larry Goldstein, MD) in collaboration with Peking University and the George Institute China (PKU Pl: Yangfeng Wu, MD, PhD) propose to establish a training program in the prevention and treatment of stroke in China, the ""Stroke Research Training Program (SRTP)."" Building on an already established partnership between Duke University and Peking University, the main objective of the SRTP is to provide stroke-focused training in clinical, population and policy research for early to mid-career physician scientists from Peking University. Drawing from courses in Duke's Master of Science in Global Health and Clinical Research Training Program, long-term training for early career researchers will lead to a (second degree) MSc in Global Health from Duke University. Medium-term training will provide methods-focused research training for mid-career PKU physician scientists seeking a specific research skill in a train the trainers model. All trainees will be exposed to DSC activities, including the DSC stroke fellowship, and to ongoing clinical research projects in the DSC, the DCRI and the DGHI. Short-term training will be provided in a yearly academic symposium to be held at PKU and by associated topic-focused colloquia and mentoring activities. Upon completion of the program, trainees will be actively involved in PKU research activities in collaboration with Duke and PKU faculty mentors. Stroke is a leading cause of death in China and is a major cause of adult disability. The proposed collaboration will enhance the research quality and sustainability of the Duke/PKU collaboration and will train researchers who will contribute to the prevention and treatment of stroke in China."

264	Metabolomic Profiling in Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease		India		March 2010	Completed	Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are reaching epidemic proportions in the US and in developing countries. India, in particular, has shown marked increases in the rates of these two diseases with major public health impact. The epidemiology and mechanisms underlying these trends are incompletely understood. Novel molecular profiling methods may help us better under these mechanisms, as well as identifying biomarkers useful for risk prediction and targeting of vulnerable populations. For example, we previously identified metabolomic signatures associated with coronary artery disease, incident cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesize that metabolomic profiling in an Indian population will validate previously identified biomarkers for CVD and DM, and will possibly identify novel biomarkers of risk. To test this hypothesis, in collaboration with Jubilant, Jubilant First Trust, and the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, we collected clinical data and biological samples in an Indian population referred for cardiac catheterization.

266	Processes Controlling Groundwater Quality and Impacts on Human Health in the Main Ethiopian Rift	Vengosh, Avner	Ethiopia		February 2010	Completed	The Main Ethiopian Rift is an example of a large population regularly exposed to naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic and fluoride in drinking water. Researchers are investigating the mechanisms in which these toxic elements are mobilized into groundwater and the relationships between aquifer geology, water quality, and health of the local population. Understanding these processes is crucial to evaluate the human health risks and ecosystem effects of inorganic contaminants and for the development of rational and cost effective remediation strategies for contaminated groundwater. This project is also helping to target safe groundwater drilling areas and identify aquifer layers that provide good quality groundwater, and will provide reliable information to policy makers for addressing the issues and improving water resources management.Conducted fieldwork in the main Ethiopian Rift Valley with extensive water samples and human nails collection. Water samples were processed at labs at Duke and data is being evaluated. Based on data collection, a large scale National Institutes of Health proposal was submitted.

268	Multi-Country Typhoid Fever Surveillence Program in sub-Saharan Africa	Crump, John	Tanzania		December 2009	Ongoing	In 2000, it was estimated that over 21.6 million episodes of typhoid fever occurred worldwide, including more than 800,000 cases in Africa. However, estimates of the burden of typhoid fever in Africa were based exclusively on placebo group incidence rates during vaccine trials in Egypt and South Africa, demonstrating a lack of contemporary population-based data on infections caused by S. Typhi in sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a lack of data on infections caused by S. Paratyphi. Currently, data on enteric fever burden is not routinely collected by the WHO, and standardized surveillance guidelines have not been established. This study is generating standardized data on the burden of disease of enteric fever in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa in order to develop prevention strategies, including immunization.

271	MOVE: Malawi Orphans & Vulnerable Children Evaluation			http://chpir.org/_homepage-content/research/move/	January 2008	Completed	Malawi Orphans and Vulnerable Children Evaluation (MOVE) was an external evaluation of the Funder's Collaborative for Children's capacity-building intervention to establish a collaborative, replicable, and sustainable system of care model for vulnerable children in Malawi. The Funder's Collaborative for Children (FCFC), a collaboration among Comic Relief, the Princess Diana Memorial Fund, Elton John AIDS Foundation, and the Children's Collaborative Investment Fund, sought to assist in increasing district and central governmental capacity to care for vulnerable children and address in an integrated and comprehensive manner the needs of orphans and vulnerable children in Malawi. The Program aimed to establish a collaborative, replicable, and sustainable model of prevention, treatment, and care, creating a system of care more able to support children and their families than the many fragmented agencies and groups that, ultimately, fail the children they serve. The external monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the impact of the intervention was a joint effort by Duke University and the Malawi College of Medicine designed to be longitudinal, evidence based, participatory, and empowering of the district and national government.The monitoring and evaluation effort was led by CHPIR and the Malawi College of Medicine (COM). CHPIR led the evaluation and provided technical assistance in the development and revision of survey instruments, sampling, the data management and quality assurance systems, and the analysis. CHPIR also trained COM partners in Stata, a statistical analysis software.Malawi Orphans and Vulnerable Children Evaluation (MOVE) may be used in a formative manner for program planning and to influence governmental and international policies about the provision of OVC services in less wealthy countries.

273	Clergy Health Initiative	Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean	United States	http://clergyhealthinitiative.org	September 2007	Ongoing	This project has both intervention and research components. The research components include a prospective cohort longitudinal data set of United Methodist Church clergy health, which collected data in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. A focus group study has also been conducted. Evaluation research has been conducted on all interventions from the Clergy Health Initiative. The project piloted in 2009-2010 an intervention that included health coaching, holistic medical exams and social support. We launched an improved 23-month holistic health intervention called Spirited Life in January 2011, with randomized cohorts participating in the intervention through 2014. Over 1,100 clergy enrolled; post-intervention data collection continued through spring 2016. We developed a church-level intervention to improve clergy mental health through support of the pastor's staff-parish relations committee. We received additional funds through June 2018 to enhance sustainability of the intervention components and disseminate project findings. In addition to writing a variety of communications, we conducted a new study of the positive mental health and well-being of clergy; we conducted 52 in-depth interviews in 2014 and additional follow-up interviews in 2015. In addition to writing journal articles, we have written a book that will be available through Baker Academic Publishing Group in Spring 2018.The panel surveys achieved response rates of 95 percent (2008), 87 percent (2010), 81 percent (2012), 75 percent (2014), and 73 percent (2016). Initial findings include high rates of clergy obesity, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis and depression, in comparison to non-clergy peers. Seventy percent of invited clergy participated in the pilot intervention, which evidenced decreases in weight, blood pressure, and depression scores, and increases in moderate and vigorous exercise. Sixty-four percent of eligible clergy (n=1,114) enrolled in the two-year intervention Spirited Life, which was an RCT utilizing a multiple baseline design. Compared to the waiting control group, intervention participants experienced significantly greater improvements in metabolic syndrome. There were no significant improvements in stress or depressive symptoms. Preliminary analyses at 18 months after the removal of services suggest maintained health improvements in multiple cohorts.The project has drawn attention from the North Carolina United Methodist Church Conferences to the physical, mental, and spiritual health needs of United Methodist clergy in North Carolina. They widely agree that the Clergy Health Initiative has led to a shift in culture of greater attention to clergy health. In the Western North Carolina Conference, the bishop changed policies to give pastors more time off when transitioning churches and has talked to churches via digital video discs about the need for pastor time off. We have had in-depth meetings with at least 6 other Christian denominations that are interested in improving the health of their clergy. Our church-based intervention, consisting of a DVD and workbook, has been ordered by churches in 18 different states and 20 United Methodist Conferences. We collaborated with the Unitarian Universalist Association on a clergy health intervention in 2014. There has also been great interest in our journal articles, including international requests from researchers in Canada, Austria, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. Our study on the positive mental health of clergy led to interest in, and funding by The Duke Endowment for, evaluation of stress management and Sabbath-keeping programs.

274	Duke Clergy Health Initiative	Toole, David	United States	http://divinity.duke.edu/initiatives-centers/clergy-health-initiative	July 2007	Ongoing	The Duke Clergy Health Initiative's definition of health is wholeness of body, mind, and spirit. We are developing a resilient, well-informed cadre of United Methodist pastors as skilled in the care of themselves and their families as they are in the care of their congregations. In 2010 the Duke Clergy Health Initiative launched Spirited Life--a multi-year health and wellness program and behavioral health study. Funded by The Duke Endowment, and cast within a framework of Wesleyan theology and spirituality, Spirited Life provides clergy with the tools they need to manage stress; learn to care for their bodies in a healthy, mindful way; and find spiritual renewal. Some 1,150 clergy in the North Carolina and Western North Carolina Conferences of the United Methodist Church are enrolled in the program and will experience these services over the next few years. It is our hope that Spirited Life will prove beneficial, enabling other United Methodist conferences and other churches and faith communities to adopt it with confidence.During the spring of 2008, the Clergy Health Initiative held a series of focus groups to hear clergy insights in small group settings. Eighty-eight individuals, including many pastors and nearly all district superintendants, participated. In the summer of 2008 and again in 2010, 2012, 2014, the Clergy Health Initiative administered surveys of all active United Methodist pastors in North Carolina. Due to extraordinary participation rates, 95 percent, 87 percent, 81 percent, and 75 percent, respectively, we gathered a wealth of information about pastors' physical, emotional, and spiritual health. We will conduct this survey again in 2016 to assess changes in clergy health over time.When combined, these two measurement vehicles: one qualitative, one quantitative - provide a compelling view into the state of these pastors' health and some of the factors influencing it, and they have helped us create the Spirited Life intervention, which has significantly lowered rates of metabolic syndrome, our primary outcome of interest.We are working with the two United Methodist conferences in North Carolina to help them plan for continuing to improve and sustain the health of their pastors.

Infections due to ESBLs are worrisome as they are resistant to multiple antibiotics and can be difficult to treat. In Sri Lanka, the clinical and molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae causing UTIs has not been well described. We conducted prospective, laboratory-based surveillance in a tertiary care hospital in southern Sri Lanka and enrolled patients %u22651 year with clinically relevant UTI due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Isolate identity, antimicrobial drug susceptibility, and ESBL production were detected and presence of ß-lactamase genes was identified by polymerase chain reaction. In this study, the majority of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were acquired in the community and due to organisms carrying the group 1 CTX-M ß-lactamase. Further epidemiologic studies of ESBL-producing infections in South Asia are urgently needed to better prevent and treat these antibiotic-resistant infections.

If the current trend persists, Sub-Saharan Africa will not reach Millennium Development Goal 4 (reduce child mortality by two thirds) until 2165, 150 years after the target date. Treatable or preventable infectious diseases such as pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea, account for 61% of childhood deaths after the neonatal period. Therefore, a large proportion of deaths from birth to the fifth birthday are attributable to a handful of common causes that are avoidable through existing interventions, many of which are delivered through health facilities. It seems probable that access to these life-saving interventions is limited by the health systems that deliver them.The objective of the proposed work is to use innovative spatial techniques to quantify the contribution of access to health services in reducing childhood morbidity and mortality. We will use large, existing datasets to describe the relationship between health outcomes and geographic distribution of health services at different spatial scales. Ultimately, the goal of such an approach is to provide evidence regarding the impact of health systems infrastructure on disease burden, independent of disease-specific interventions. The impact of health systems is difficult to measure and large comparison studies or randomized trials are often not feasible. However, applying spatial statistical techniques to this problem can provide evidence for causal relationships in the absence of a counterfactual.W. P. O'Meara, A. Platt, V. Naanyu, D. Cole, S.

Buckee ""Quantifying the impact of accessibility on preventative healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa"", Epidemiology, 26:223—228 (2015)Health systems are the foundational infrastructure through which life-saving interventions are delivered. However, their impact on population health is difficult to measure. Our analysis of large-scale survey data reveals important associations between health systems characteristics and child survival in Kenya, independent of utilization or specific interventions, and lends weight to the argument that user fees for child services are detrimental to child survival. Furthermore, the presence of highly trained staff do not appear to be the limiting factor in Kenya. Instead, more attention should be given to understanding the role of the private sector and investment in improving the distribution of health services infrastructure."

292	Religious Engagement and Psychopathology over the Lifecourse		United States		July 2009	Completed	Our understanding of how religious engagement and spirituality impact an individual's risk of mental health problems over the life-course is still quite limited. This is despite the fact that 30-40% of Americans participate in weekly religious activities and almost half will develop a psychiatric illness over the course of their lifetime. While the number of research studies in this area has recently grown, the lack of longitudinal data has hindered the interpretation of most findings. This study examines in greater detail the relationship between religious engagement and psychopathology over the life-course by taking advantage of multiple waves of data on both religious engagement and psychopathology that cover several decades. Using survival analysis techniques, we analyzed data from three follow-up studies of the New England Cohorts of the National Collaborate Perinatal Project (NCPP) to test the following hypotheses: 1. religious engagement will be protective against future risk and remission of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and anti social personality disorder; 2. a stable pattern of religious engagement over time will be associated with the lowest risk of illness; 3. religious engagement will buffer the association between childhood behavioral risk factors and risk of adult psychopathology; and 4. levels of religious service attendance and spiritual well-being will interact and together be uniquely be associated with psychopathology. Drawing on prior research showing gender and race/ethnicity differences in both religiosity and psychopathology, we will also examine any evidence of these differences in the observed associations. This research overcomes the limitations of prior studies by (1) utilizing data both on religious activity and psychopathology from multiple time points, (2) using measures of psychopathology assessed according to DSM criteria, and (3) integrating data on both religious service attendance and spiritual well-being.

294	Curriculum for Training Technicians	Malkin, Robert	Cambodia,Honduras,Nigeria,Rwanda		June 2009	Ongoing	"Develop a curriculum for training technicians in Rwanda with potential application to other countries; 15 hospitals in Rwanda have signed up to use the Duke, evidence-based curriculum. The basis for the training will be a new curriculum developed by undergraduates at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering. Allison Keane (2009 Biomedical Engineering) did the basic research, analyzing reports from several thousand pieces of broken medical equipment and spending a summer in Africa with the Engineering World Health-Duke Summer Institute in 2008. Keane determined why medical equipment that works in the US fails when it arrives in the developing world. Using that information, Jenna Maloka (2009 Biomedical Engineering) and Keane determined what knowledge one would need to return the equipment to service in a resource-poor setting. Then, Mhoire and Kathleen Murphy (2009 Biomedical Engineering) and Marian Dickinson (2010 Biomedical Engineering) converted that knowledge into a curriculum that could be taught to secondary school graduates. Rwanda has been experiencing a remarkable recovery from a devastating civil war. However, the nation still suffers from a severe lack of trained personnel in the health care professions. There simply aren't enough doctors, nurses or biomedical engineers to keep the health care system running in Rwanda. In fact, there isn't even a school to train biomedical engineers or biomedical engineering technicians in the country.The curriculum created by Pratt's undergraduates teaches skills specific to a resource poor hospital; for example, substituting a broken fuse from the marketplace in an electrocardiogram when the exact replacement fuse is not available. The plan in Rwanda is to teach the new curriculum, as part of a longer curriculum - that Pratt is also developing - for three years, then use Rwandan graduates from the first years of the program to perpetuate the instruction. ""We're very excited about this roll-out,"" said Dr. Robert Malkin, Director of Engineering World Health-Duke. ""We've also discussed rolling out this curriculum in Ethiopia and Mozambique with the Centers for Disease Control. ""The World Health Organization estimates that most of the medical equipment in the developing world is not working. Broken equipment causes millions to go without treatment every year. The work of these Pratt students goes a long way towards making health care available to all."	Health policy and systems	General Electric Foundation		
295	Investigating Salinity and Radioactivity in Water Resources in Morocco	Vengosh, Avner			May 2009	Completed	Morocco is one of the most arid regions of the world and based on many Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate models annual rainfall is expected to decrease over the next few decades. With increasing demands for drinking water and irrigation (90 percent of water in Morocco is used for agriculture) the water crisis in Morocco is expected to become exaggerated. The increase in groundwater exploitation is also associated with a rapid increase of the salinity in many of the aquifer systems of Morocco. The high salinity of groundwater has become a limiting factor for sustainable management of the water resources, and therefore has important implications for future economic development and social and political stability in Morocco. Water authorities are already struggling to distribute and provide potable water to the domestic and agricultural sectors. This North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) project aims to investigate the groundwater quality (with a focus on the effects of salinity and radioactivity) of four major basins in Morocco (Souss-Massa, Draa, Ziz, and Tadla) through a collaborative effort between Duke University and University of Ibn Zohr in Agadir. This study aims to provide a systematic analysis of geochemical and isotopic compositions of saline ground waters from the selected aquifers, which will help to evaluate the sources of salinity, mechanisms for salinization, as well as the first investigation of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides in water resources in Morocco. Identifying the origin of salinity and radioactivity is crucial for water management, model prediction, and remediation. This analysis will help to establish a scientifically-based water management plan with specific recommendations for the end-users for sustainable exploitation of the water sources in the investigated basins and potential implications on population health.Several publications and a few more papers on progress: Vinson, D.S., Tagma, T., Bouchaou, L., Dwyer, G.S., Nathaniel R.

Sikkema and Seth Kalichman (University of Connecticut) Investigators: Melissa Watt Funder: NIAAA, R01, 2008-2014 Site: Cape Town, South Africa This study, conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, aimed to understand women's HIV risks in the context of alcohol-serving establishments in one urban township. The data included in-depth qualitative interviews with a range of stakeholders, repeated cross-sectional surveys of venue patrons, and a longitudinal cohort of women who frequent the study venues. 12 distinct venues were selected for involvement in the study. Over four time points in one year, 2,783 patrons completed the surveys, and a cohort of 560 women were followed longitudinally.An overarching theme among this population was the presence of poor mental health, particularly PTSD and depression, coupled with HIV risk behaviors and high alcohol consumption. The team has published over a dozen papers, both quantitative and qualitative, examining issues such as mental health, alcohol use, traumatic experiences, and food insecurity. Outcomes indicate a large presence of substance use among this population, particularly heavy alcohol consumption and use of methamphetamine. Both qualitative and quantitative data point to the pervasive practice of gender-based violence, sometimes facilitated by the venue atmosphere. Specifically, forced sex and other traumatic experiences were endorsed by the majority of women.	HIV/AIDS,Substance use,Violence	NIH-National Institute of Mental Health	Stellenbosch University	
298	Advancing and Diffusing Knowledge on Muslim-Americans	Read, Jen'nan			August 2008	Completed	This grant supported the advancement and diffusion of Dr. Read's research on Muslim American political incorporation. As a Carnegie Scholar, she has spent the past two years examining this issue and is eager to share her findings with a broader audience than is traditionally reached through academic outlets. To this end, she proposes to partner with Duke University and use the funds for web development and strategic outreach and communication. The overarching goal is to translate Dr. Read's academic findings into a language that is easily accessible to a broad audience, including educators, policy-makers, journalists, and individuals, both here and abroad. Dr. Read's work speaks directly to the widespread concern over the compatibility of Islam and democracy. By comparing Muslim Americans to other immigrant and religious groups, she has shown that their experiences are no different from earlier immigrant arrivals, including Italians, Jews, and Japanese. She has also shown that their political values and behaviors are no different from other Americans today, including Evangelical Christians. This information is not available to most Americans, but it needs to be. The second and equally important part of the project is outreach and communication - making both the research and the website visible, both locally and globally. This will also involve working closely with the Office of News and Communications to publicize the website via major search engines and other outlets, hiring a publicist to reach venues that are beyond the scope of the communications office. Dr. Read will also work with non-profit organizations, such as the Arab American Institute Foundation, to make the work visible in policy arenas.

300	Doubly disenfranchised? How Race/Ethnicity and Religiosity Shape Muslim American Political Incorporation	Read, Jen'nan	United States		July 2008	Completed	This study will draw from the only existing nationally representative data on Muslim Americans to identify the factors that influence their political incorporation. Building on theories of raciallethnic and immigrant political incorporation, this study will examine the extent to which South Asian, Arab, and African American Muslims differ in their political attitudes and behaviors and assess whether and how socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural differences between these groups explain observed variations in their attitudes and behaviors. Further, this study will expand theories on the religion-politics connection by examining how different dimensions of religious identity (e.g., personal, organizational, and political) affect their political incorporation. The primary purpose of the study is to examine the factors that influence the political incorporation of Muslim Americans and assess whether and how this varies by racial and ethnic group membership. Specifically, the project aims to answer four related questions: 1. To what extent do South Asian, Arab, and African American Muslims differ in their political attitudes and behaviors? 2. To what extent do socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural differences between these groups explain observed variations in their attitudes and behaviors? 3. To what extent do different dimensions of religious identity (e.g., personal, organizational, and political) affect their political incorporation? and 4. To what extent do the factors that produce differences between groups generate differences within each group?	Impacts of race and culture	Russell Sage Foundation

309	The Role of Mission Hospitals in African Health Systems: Case Studies from the Nile River Basin	Toole, David	Uganda			Ongoing	Prominent among the faith-based institutions that provide health care in sub-Saharan Africa are mission hospitals established by Christian missionaries from the late nineteenth century to the present, as well as hospitals established by Africans as part of the legacy of Christian missions. By focusing on pioneer and legacy mission hospitals in one region (the upper Nile River Basin) of sub-Saharan Africa, this research project seeks to answer three broad questions concerning the current state of African health systems. (1) How did things come to be this way? How have faith-based contributions to these health systems evolved from the earliest mission hospitals in the nineteenth century to now? (2) What precisely is the current role of these faith-based networks in African health systems? How are they financed? How are they managed? What portion of care do they provide, in what varying geographical contexts? What are the political, economic, and social factors that define their relationships with government, on one hand, and with the communities they serve, on the other? (3) Given their historical and current role in these health systems, what might the future hold? How might the past and the present realities of mission hospitals and their legacy inform the future of African health systems?Research in progress.In many countries, these hospitals anchor a large network of health facilities. In Uganda, for example, the Catholic Church and a small collection of protestant denominations, manage not only 47 hospitals, but more than 500 lower-level health facilities, many of them providing the only available care for Uganda's predominately rural population. This heavy dependence of national health systems in sub-Saharan Africa on faith-based facilities funded largely by external sources makes these systems vulnerable, especially when these facilities themselves are in crisis, as is increasingly the case with many mission hospitals. This research will inform debates about the ongoing role of faith-based facilities as part of national health systems in sub-Saharan Africa.

We are using geochemical and isotopic tracers to delineate the contaminants sources and the sustainability of groundwater in the Mekong Delta.The project will provide an in-depth analysis of the sources of water contamination in groundwater from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Future developments in generating hydropower and dam constructions in the upper sections of the Mekong River basin are expected to reduce the downstream flows of the Mekong River. The ability of groundwater to sustain the expected water deficit is one of the major challenges of Vietnam and other countries in the region.The outcome of the project will have important implication for future negotiations on the distribution of the Mekong River and the minimum water flows that should be maintained in the river.

319	Developing a Regional Cancer Registry in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania	Zafar, Yousuf	Tanzania			Ongoing	1.To conduct a needs assessment related to cancer registry development in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. 2. To create a sustainable foundation for developing a population-based cancer registry in the Kilimanjaro region, based at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center.Assessing the perceptions of healthcare providers and administrators is a critical foundation for establishing a sustainable population-based cancer registry. Without a clear understanding of these organizational perceptions cancer registry expansion and development might not be aligned with the organization’s values and needs. Our long-term goal is to lay the foundation for the highest-quality cancer research, clinical care, and policy development in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. As part of the ongoing parent project, an inventory of registry-related resources that are already in place at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) has been planned. Despite the best available resources, understanding perceptions and attitudes of the healthcare workforce surrounding cancer registry activities are critical to successful implementation.	Cancer

Solis, MD, MPHa, Javier Pastor, MDb, Santos Calderwood, MDc, Rosemary Duda, MDd, Nathan Thielman, MDa, Sandhya Lagoo, MD, PhDa Presented as a poster at the 6th annual ASAP meeting, Durham, NC September 2013 A Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC B Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Rosales Arguello, León, Nicaragua C Hospital Regional Augusto Cesar Molina, Matagalpa, Nicaragua D Beth Israel Medical Center, Boston, MA Background: Access to surgical care can vary based on differences in geography and lead to differences in severity of initial presentation, especially in lower and middle income countries such as Nicaragua. The goal of this study was to determine factors leading to delayed presentations in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in two Nicaraguan ministry of health hospitals located in León and Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Additionally, post-operative outcomes were tracked and measured. Methods: A 1-year (October 2012-2013) prospective study comparing access to surgical care, delayed presentations and surgical outcomes in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in León and Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Data regarding sociodemographic factors, transportation barriers, intra-operative findings, initial presentations, baseline co-morbidities, and post-operative outcomes was collected via patient interviews, review of the medical record and intra-hospital follow-up. Results: Preliminary analysis was performed on 495 patients. 190 patients were from León (38.3%) and 305 (61.2%) patients were from Matagalpa. Median presentation time was 19 hrs in Matagalpa vs. 16 hrs in León (p<0.0001). Mean travel time to the hospital was also greater in Matagalpa than León (0.75 hrs vs.0.5 hrs, p<0.0159). However, median travel distance in km was not different (p<0.07). Conclusion: Most likely because of geographical barriers and differences in socioeconomic status, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital presentation is longer in patients in Matagalpa. Additionally, patients in Matagalpa travel longer times to get to the hospital despite similar distances to patients in León.This project will help policy regarding allocation of resources to Departments of Surgery in Leon and Matagalpa.

The goal of the project is to utilize innovative technology and an executive training model to assist practicing anesthetists in completing their degree, allowing for a continuity of care in the community and opportunities to train additional nurses to administer anesthesia.One primary goal is to understand how distance based technology is applied in resource constrained environments and investigate in what ways it can be helpful in mitigating the health-worker shortage in rural areas. A robust analysis of the project development, use, and implementation would provide the foundation for a sustainable and scalable model of education. Data will be collected on three areas for progress on these fronts: 1. Use and application of the technology, 2. Student learning outcomes and differences, and 3. Behavioral learning factors with the product that could allow increases in the quality of e-education.	Health care access,Health policy and systems	Duke University	Duke School of Nursing

SCWO is a promising innovation to treat fecal sludge, because it works quickly and generates energy in the forms of hot water and steam. Supercritical water treatment effectively eliminates all types of harmful organisms and does not require, prior dewatering or drying of fecal, sludge. SCWO treatment also results in clean water that can be reused.A SCWO prototype has been designed and constructed at Duke in a 20 ft shipping container. Testing and operation on Duke campus is ongoing. The unit can treat ~1 ton of wet fecal sludge per day, the amount of generated by ~1200 people.

There are many possible avenues for development of initiatives, but we are currently focusing on the possibility of a Workshop on Global Health Theory and Practice, with video and digital components, to be done by Duke faculty including myself, Brandon Kohrt, Bonnie Kaiser, Dennis Clements, and perhaps others. Such a workshop could yield educational materials for the health care personnel who rotate through St. Damiens from many US medical institutions, and engage further cultural interaction with Haitian health care personnel. The workshop would allow us to dialogue with Father Rick and his colleagues, and to target the best opportunities for DGHI undergrads or Masters students.

330	Engineering Club at WISER NGO	Ramanujam, Nimmi	United States,Kenya	http://gwht.pratt.duke.edu/		Ongoing	During 2014, fellows at the GWHT Center worked with staff at WISER NGO to develop and found an engineering club at the WISER secondary school for girls in Muhuru Bay Kenya. The staff at WISER indicated that lighting, particularly for use in the school during blackouts and in the light-poor community in general, was a fundamental need of the area. During the spring semester, fellows developed a six-week curriculum to teach high-school girls at WISER NGO to make renewable-energy lights using local materials and sell them within their community. Rather than donating lights, they empowered girls to be change-makers and leveraged the resource of motivated women to address Muhuru Bay's light deficit. During the summer, two fellows traveled to Muhuru Bay to found the club and implement their curriculum. Their efforts were hugely successful. The girls designed and constructed 26 flashlights currently used during school blackouts. During the club's activities, the idea for community sales came from members of the school, indicating community interest. Before leaving Kenya, the fellows left in place a six-week design challenge structure, where the girls would identify a community need and work to design the best light source for that application. Recognizing that this would require continued funding, upon returning to Duke in the fall, the fellows organized a crowd-sourced funding campaign, and work continues to design a plan to make the engineering club at WISER a self-sustaining entity through a community sales program.

332	Do increasing block tariffs lead to water conservation? Evidence from Hangzhou, China	Jeuland, Marc	China			Ongoing	The aims of the project are two-fold. The first aim is to evaluate the effects of IBT adoption on water consumption and water conservation in a major Chinese city (Hangzhou). To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first empirical study of IBT implementation using panel data in China. The second aim is to better understand households water use practices, and specifically whether they trust that network water is safe to drink, relative to other more expensive options such as bottled water. While some literature has discussed the public perception of drinking water quality (Turgeon et al. 2004, Doria et al. 2009, Doria 2010, Saylor et al. 2011), there has been limited research to date in the context of China (Zhang and Brown 2005).

334	Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery					Ongoing	The Sumatran-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2004 and the subsequent tsunami constitute one of the most powerful and deadly disasters in world history. The damage in the Indonesian province of Aceh was extreme. Some 160,000 individuals perished and an estimated 4.5 billion dollars of property was destroyed. By 2007, efforts to repair the damage and rebuild destroyed infrastructure constituted one of the largest projects ever undertaken in a developing country setting. To provide evidence on the consequences of the disaster and the evolution of the recovery effort, our team in conjunction with Statistics Indonesia, fielded multiple surveys in Aceh and North Sumatra as part of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR). STAR is designed to provide data for studying behaviors and outcomes associated with the tsunami and the subsequent recovery. The survey collects information at the individual and household levels, including multiple indicators of economic well-being (consumption, income, and assets); education, migration, and labor market outcomes; marriage, fertility, and contraceptive use; health status and use of health care; relationships among coresident and non-coresident family members; transfers among family members and inter-generational mobility; and participation in community activities.

339	Sabbath Living Evaluation	Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean	United States	http://www.blessedearth.org/		Ongoing	Sabbath Living is an intervention designed to teach and encourage United Methodist clergy in North Carolina to set apart one day a week for spiritual and recreational activities. The intervention consists of workshops of varying lengths which may be attended multiple times; written materials; and optional participation in a network of clergy who encourage Sabbath-keeping through regular joint prayer. While keeping Sabbath is a religious practice that people may want to engage in regardless of health benefit, an open research question is whether keeping Sabbath affects mental health. In this evaluation, we will compare the positive mental health and spiritual well-being outcomes (primary outcomes), as well as depression and anxiety outcomes (secondary outcomes) between two groups of clergy: 1) clergy who attend a Sabbath Living workshop and proceed to engage in Sabbath-keeping, versus 2) clergy who attend a Sabbath Living workshop and do not go on to engage in Sabbath-keeping. In addition to these outcomes, the explanatory pathway of social support will be examined. In the first year, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 clergy at 6 and 12 months post-workshop to understand barriers to, and facilitators of, Sabbath-keeping, as well as perceived changes in mental and spiritual well-being. Across four years, we will conduct surveys at the time of the workshop plus 3 and 9 months post-workshop with an anticipated 750 clergy.Future policy implications of this study include how busy caregivers are able to set a day and whether or not it is advisable to recommend keeping Sabbath not just because it is one of ten commandments in the Bible, but because it is beneficial for positive mental health.

352	Womens and Childrens Health Initiatives in Haiti		Haiti	http://www.familyhm.org		Ongoing	"Family Health Ministries is an institutional partner of DGHI, which has been conducting research on cervical cancer prevention in Haiti since 1993. This research has led to the development of a screening protocol that has been adopted by the Haitian Ministry of Health and the introduction of HPV laboratories in Haiti. In October 2015, FHM began assisting the Haitian Ministry of Health to develop a unified national screening effort by co-founding a new NGO called ""Haiti sans Cervical Cancer"", an organization dedicated to reducing the burden of cervical cancer in Haiti through coordinated partnerships. Over the last year HsCC has grown to many new partners including Zanmi Lasante (Partners in Health) & GHESKIO. FHM's other research interests have been expanded to investigate novel strategies for reducing maternal infant mortality; understanding & preventing the sequelae of hypertension as well as understanding the role of HPV in head and neck cancers in Haiti. FHM objectives include helping prepare Duke students to become global health leaders by supervising their participation in community health research efforts to discover novel approaches to improving health care delivery in Haiti. To support FHM's research and education objectives, it is building infrastructure in the Leogane commune that will constitute a model for a regional health system and be available for student research.

353	Global Access to Surgical Health Care in Rural India	Lagoo-Deenadayalan, Sandhya	India			Ongoing	To establish a symbiotic relationship at Duke University, a reputable urban hospital and an established rural health-related NGO will help in the dissemination of advanced medical knowledge and technology in the urban areas, while advocating and implementing means to make quality surgical care available to the urban poor and rural populations. We hope this will promote internal (urban to rural) technology transfer. More importantly, through sharing of cutting edge technology with them, we hope to provide incentives to urban surgeons to work in rural areas. Some of the low-cost health care models established by NGOs in the rural setting can be reverse-engineered to fit the urban environment. We hope this will encourage and foster clinical and outcomes research in both rural and urban settings.1. Comparison of scope, safety, and impact of surgery in rural and urban settings in Maharashtra, India. Janeil M. Belle, Rani A. Bang, Dhananjay Kelkar, Truls Østbye, Sandhya A. Lagoo-Deenadayalan. 2014. Submitted to World Journal of Surgery, 2014 Background: In medically underserved regions worldwide, non-permanent surgery programs or camps have been conducted to expand access to surgical services. Surgery camp programs have been reported in rural India, primarily in ophthalmic and obstetric fields; however, provision of general surgical services in these settings is largely unknown. Methods: A 12-month retrospective review of non-ambulatory procedures performed at a rural hospital surgery camp program and at an urban hospital in Maharashtra, India, was completed to characterize relative differences in procedural activity, frequency and severity of perioperative complications, and to evaluate the efficacy of care. Results: 449 cases were performed in rural hospital surgery camps and compared with 344 cases performed in the urban hospital in the study period. Majority of rural surgical cases were elective and intermediate complexity. Approximately 4% of rural cases were complex-major compared to 17% of urban cases. Intraoperative complications occurred in 0.2% rural cases compared to 5.5% of urban cases, p= 0.01. Postoperative complications were predominantly low grade in both groups. The postoperative complication rate was higher among rural surgical patients (43.4%; 23.5%, p<0.01), though the Surgical Risk Score was significantly lower in this group (p<0. 01). Rural surgery camp activity over 12 months achieved diagnostic and/or therapeutic goals in 92.2% of procedures and rendered 1.74-2.69 DALYs-averted-per-patient. Conclusion: Rural general surgery camps can safely and effectively provide a wide range of surgical services under appropriate collaborative and clinical conditions. They may be a safe, temporizing solution to observed needs until substantial gains in rural healthcare are realized. 2. Levels of Surgical Disease and Predictors of Barriers to Care in Rural India. Jessica Lynn Hudson, Sandhya Lagoo%u2010Deenadayalan, Truls Østbye, Christopher Woods. Thesis Submission (2012) for Master of Science in the Duke Global Health Institute in the Graduate School of Duke University Manuscript in preparation An estimated 234.2 million major surgical procedures are performed annually worldwide, yet the wealthiest third of the world's population receives 73.6% while the world's poorest third receives only 3.5%. Approximately one%u2010third of the global population has no access to basic surgical care. Knowing that large unmet surgical need in a community can lead to high morbidity and mortality in the population, the purpose of this novel study was to assess the level of surgical conditions in rural Gadchiroli, India as well as to conduct a quantitative assessment of the barriers to surgical care. In this retrospective, cross%u2010sectional needs assessment, a study%u2010specific survey was administered in a clinic%u2010based setting. Of the 500 participants, 141 (28.2%) reported surgical conditions, for a total of 175 surgical cases, in the preceding two years. The conditions with the highest prevalence were hydrocele, anorectal processes, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, cataracts, appendicitis, and spondylosis with neurologic claudication. Assessment of the conditions by a healthcare provider occurred in 133 (76.6%) of the cases of which only 32 (24.1%) reported having undergone surgery during the two year period. Overall, in this population, the burden of surgical disease is higher than previously expected and while willingness to undergo surgery is high, the completion rate is quite low. Certain factors appear to predict difficulty in seeking or receiving surgical care, including lost wages (p=0.027), the amount of time that family members need to stay in the hospital to hBoth studies described above will help shape policy regarding work force decisions for surgical care in rural Maharashtra and also help decision making regarding split funding for urban surgeons willing to help with surgical care via surgical camps in rural settings.

354	Development of Low Cost Optical Technologies for Cervical Pre-Cancer Detection	Ramanujam, Nimmi	Haiti			Ongoing	A significant challenge in detecting cervical pre-cancer in low-resource settings is the lack of effective screening techniques and trained personnel to detect the disease before it is advanced. Light-based technologies have the potential to provide an eff ective, low-cost and portable solution for cervical pre-cancer screening in these communities. The goal of this project is to design, engineer and field test a USB-powered hand-held optical device for cervical pre-cancer screening in Haiti. This technology is based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy which was shown to be effective in the detection of high grade cervical pre-cancers (pre-cancerous disease that is most likely to progress into cancer) in a 39-patient clinical study at the Duke University Medical Center. The work brings together biomedical engineer Dr. Nimmi Ramanujam and Duke physicians, Drs. Peter Cartwright and David Walmer. This project provides the resources necessary to establish this collaboration, build a prototype, and conduct preliminary testing at a field clinic in Haiti. This project will provide evidence of the feasibility of using a low-cost optical device for screening cervical cancer in resource-poor communities in Haiti. We have designed two smart sensor prototypes. The designs are currently being validated in a 100-patient clinical study in Haiti.	Health care access,Cancer,Engineering	Duke University		
355	On-Site Packaging of ARV Dosed for the Prevention of Transmission of HIV from Mother to Child	Malkin, Robert	Tanzania,Uganda,Ecuador			Ongoing	There may be as many as 2.1 million children worldwide infected with HIV; and the number continues to grow. The United Nations estimates that more than 1,900 children are being infected every day. Over the past 15 years, several options have become available for treating children and preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child, including zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddl) and nevirapine (NVP). A single dose of nevirapine, for example, delivered within 24 hours of birth has been shown to dramatically reduce the chances that the child will contract HIV from the mother (Guay, 1999). To aid in the treatment and prevention of HIV in resource limited settings, an improved method of packaging single use doses of nevirapine has been developed that allows a foilized pouch to be heat sealed by a pharmacist on-site, using only boiling water. There is no syringe. After birth, the mother rips open the foil pouch (like tearing open a take-out ketchup container from McDonalds) and squeezes the drug into the infant's mouth. Preliminary data shows that this packaging dramatically extends the life of the drug. This study has two objectives: 1. gather data on the chemical stability of nevirapine packaged in heat sealed (boiling water), foilized pouches and 2. design and test the acceptability for mothers of directly squeezing liquid (water in this case) from a foilized pouch into their newborn's mouth. Ideally, single doses could be distributed to health huts and stored for months, allowing nevirapine to be used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV far into the rural health care delivery system.

371	Development and Evaluation of a Family- and Church-based Intervention for Mental Health Promotion and HIV Prevention for Adolescents in Rural Kenya	Puffer, Eve	Kenya			Completed	A community-based participatory process was used to develop an intervention for families in a rural community in Western Kenya. As HIV prevalence in this area is estimated at 15.3% and mental healthcare is virtually non-existent, the intervention focuses on preventing mental health problems and sexual risk behavior among youth ages 10 to 16, as well as empowering families to use local resources for economic gain. The intervention is entitled READY: Resiience Education And skill Development of Youth and families and includes 9 sessions delivered to groups of families in churches. All sessions focus on improving family communication and relationships as the foundation for reaching intervention goals. The intervention is based in large part on results from a large, mixed methods formative study that revealed associations between sexual risk behavior, emotional and behavioral health, and HIV-prevention messages that youth receive from their families and adults in the community. A randomized controlled pilot trial of the intervention has been completed, and further development and expansion of the program is currently underway.Relative to controls, the intervention group reported better family communication across domains at 1- and 3-months post-intervention and higher self-efficacy for risk reduction skills and HIV-related knowledge at 1-month post-intervention. Sexually active youth in the intervention reported fewer high-risk behaviors at 1-month post-intervention, including unprotected sex or multiple partners. Male caregivers in the intervention reported higher parental involvement at both time points, and youth reported more social support from male caregivers at 3-months post-intervention. No effects on secondary outcomes of parenting, social support, and mental health were detected. This intervention holds promise for strengthening positive family processes to protect against negative future outcomes for adolescents. Implementation with religious congregations may be a promising strategy for improving sustainability and scalability of interventions in low-resource settings. Puffer, E. S., Green, E.

378	Aging and Social Isolation in Singapore: a community survey	Ostbye (Østbye), Truls	Singapore			Ongoing	Singapore is one of the most rapidly aging countries in Asia. The proportion of older adults (aged 60 years and over) in the population, currently about 8%, is projected to increase to 19% by 2030. At the same time, the number of elderly households in Singapore is rising rapidly owing to increased prevalence of smaller, nuclear families and the trend of more people remaining single. To design evidence-based policies and programs to enhance social networks and prevent social isolation among seniors and to plan for the health care needs of the elderly in the future, a Social Isolation, Health and Lifestyle Survey (SIHLS) was conducted. The main objectives of the survey was to: develop a longitudinal database on the physical and mental health profile of older adults (aged 60 ); to determine the extent of social isolation among older adults, and changes with time, within and between income groups; understand the interactions among health status, income, social engagement, housing, network support and loneliness; the constraints on and channels for social participation and the preferences for preventing and responding to isolation. It provided information comparable to similar longitudinal surveys in Japan and Philippines.

383	Improving Outcomes of Traumatic Brain Injuries: Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center	Staton, Catherine	Tanzania			Ongoing	Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as intracranial injury, occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain. TBI can be classified based on severity, mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury), or other type of injury (e.g., focal hemorrhage, subdurhal hematoma or diffuse axonal injury). TBI is a critical public health problem worldwide and is the most common cause of death and disability for injury patients. According to WHO, injury will be a major cause of death and disability by the year 2020. It is estimated that TBI affects about 10million people worldwide leading to hospitalization or mortality.1 The burden of TBI in many countries varies and is poorly understood. TBI are a major public health problem effecting society effecting children and family's sociologic, employment, economic, and health status. TBI can cause a host of physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural effects and its outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death. In Africa, TBI has its highest prevalence for men of economically productive years, 25-44 years of age.1 Globally, road traffic injuries (RTI) cause over 60% of TBI deaths thus highlighting the significant public health nature of this problem. Rapid economic growth in developing countries and consequent urbanization, which tends to accompany dramatic increases in vehicles that has resulted in catastrophic incidences of TBI in these countries. These same regions have shown the highest rates for TBI related injuries due to violence. In many LMIC, there is a poor reporting system, which makes understanding the true magnitude of the TBI burden poorly understood. Most literature from Africa discusses head injury, not the more precise clinically precise traumatic brain injury, which makes literature from Africa difficult to use for comparisons. Most studies are also hospital based, with undefined catchment areas, and are subject to care seeking limitations at both severe and milder ends of the spectrum. CPG have been developed in high resource, high-income settings in order to standardize care for TBI patients. The institution of CPG and standardization of the management of TBI has been shown to improve patient mortality rates and neurologic outcomes in high-income settings.2 Unfortunately, there are no current resource appropriate CPG for TBI in LMIC that have been shown to improve outcomes. **General Objective** To improve outcomes for Traumatic Brain Injury patients through an evidence based, multidisciplinary quality improvement project **Specific Objectives** 1. Collect prospective TBI patient care data in order to identify current treatment and potential quality improvement areas 2. Perform a systematic review of international LMIC acute TBI management 3. Develop a multi-disciplinary team to utilize current TBI care data and a the systematic review of international TBI CPG to create a resource appropriate acute TBI diagnostic and stabilization treatment protocol 4. Evaluate the impact of the CPG implementation* Established a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Clinical Registry * Completed a quality systematic review of all acute TBI management clinical practice guidelines in high and low resource settings: submitted pending acceptance * Establish a resource appropriate Clinical Practice Guideline to improve acute care of TBI patients * Submitted grants seeking funding for CPG implementation and evaluationThis project has already improved outcomes for TBI patients at KCMC by improving quality of care delivered at the KCMC Casualty Department.

384	Stillbirths and Neonatal Mortality in Project villages of the comprehensive Rural health Project	Ariely, Sumedha	India			Completed	The purpose of this project is to investigate causes and risk factors for perinatal and neonatal mortality in villages that work with CRHP in Maharasthra India. Subsets of risk factors may include prenatal practices, knowledge and local perceptions towards causes of neonatal mortality, and access to and choice of childbirth services. Data from this project may be combined with previous data collected at Jamkhed to identify trends in neonatal mortality rates and their relation to important demographic characteristics such as child gender, family education and economic status. Additionally, other risk factors such as premature birth or low birth weight will be evaluated to determine prevalence in Jamkhed villages and relationship to mortality outcomes. Identifying causes behind these risk factors may contribute to determining effective prevention strategies. Data from this project will help our community partner continue to assess needs and progress made in perinatal and maternal health and may help add to and inform quality care recommendations being made at the national and international level.

387	Naama Community Health Collaboration	Ariely, Sumedha	Uganda			Ongoing	In 2008, the Naama community and a group of Duke students and faculty partnered to form the Naama Community Health Collaboration. Naama is located in the Mityana District of Uganda, about 100 kilometers away from the capital city of Kampala. The community mainly survives on subsistence farming, with some fishing and petty trade. Each year, the Duke community works with Naama to advance community health and development goals. The ongoing work throughout the year is propagated by a student led on ground collaborative experience. Over the course of each academic year, the team works with faculty and community partners of NCHC to review the initiatives of the past summer and identify new areas for improvement. Key issues that emerge from discussions have been experience of the dying and chronically ill in Naama, role of traditional medicine, water and sanitation, maternal health, nutrition of children, assessment of how an emergency medical system could be set up, and communication and collaboration among local organizations. Developed projects ask core questions for each community identified issue. Some general question areas are: 1. Palliative Care and Traditonal Medicine a. What are palliative care needs in Naama? b. What is the role of traditional medicine and support in the health care of the community? 2. Water and Sanitation a. What are water and sanitation practices and needs in the community? 3. Maternal health, Nutrition, and Emergency Medical System a. What are challenges mothers face before, during, and after pregnancy in Naama? 4. What is the on-going nutritional status and needs of children in Naama community? a. What are the rates of Malaria, Anemia and Worm infections in school-aged children 5. How integrated are local nonprofit organizations in the Mityana area and what are mechanisms for coordinating efforts across agencies?We work with local health professionals and agencies to develop service and research priorities and provide information that helps them and the community set education needs and agendas.
