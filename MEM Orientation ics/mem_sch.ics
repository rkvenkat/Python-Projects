Individuals who have taken KORU courses indicate improvements in several areas: better sleep, increased self-awareness, sharper focus, and reduced anxiety. Several 4-week sessions will be offered throughout the fall semester as an opportunity to dive deeper into the practice. Registration for this introductory session is limited to 85 students. Register here.
