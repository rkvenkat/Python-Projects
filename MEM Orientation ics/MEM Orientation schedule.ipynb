       "35   KORU Mindfulness is a method of mindfulness, meditation, and stress management designed for emerging adults, ages 18-29, but is suitable for all ages interested in beginning or re-engaging with their mindfulness practice. Individuals who have taken KORU courses indicate improvements in several areas: better sleep, increased self-awareness, sharper focus, and reduced anxiety. Several 4-week sessions will be offered throughout the fall semester as an opportunity to dive deeper into the practice. Registration for this introductory session is limited to 85 students.
